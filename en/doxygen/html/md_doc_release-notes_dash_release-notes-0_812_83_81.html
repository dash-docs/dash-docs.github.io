<p><a href="https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets">https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets</a></p>
<p>This is a new major version release, bringing new features, various bugfixes and other improvements.</p>
<p>Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues">https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues</a></p>
<h1>Upgrading and downgrading </h1>
<h2>How to Upgrade </h2>
<p>If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).</p>
<h2>Downgrade warning </h2>
<h3>Downgrade to a version &lt; 0.12.2.2</h3>
<p>Because release 0.12.2.2 included the <a href="release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.12.2.2.md#per-utxo-fix">per-UTXO fix</a> which changed the structure of the internal database, you will have to reindex the database if you decide to use any pre-0.12.2.2 version.</p>
<p>Wallet forward or backward compatibility was not affected.</p>
<h3>Downgrade to 0.12.2.2/3</h3>
<p>Downgrading to these versions does not require any additional actions, should be fully compatible.</p>
<h1>Notable changes </h1>
<h2>Introducing Named Devnets </h2>
<p>We introduce a new feature called <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/1791">Named Devnets</a>. This feature allows the creation of multiple independent devnets. Each one is identified by a name which is hardened into a "devnet genesis" block, which is automatically positioned at height 1. Validation rules will ensure that a node from <code>devnet=test1</code> will never be able to accept blocks from <code>devnet=test2</code>. This is done by checking the expected devnet genesis block.</p>
<p>The genesis block of the devnet is the same as the one from regtest. This starts the devnet with a very low difficulty, allowing us to fill up needed balances for masternodes very fast.</p>
<p>Also, the devnet name is put into the sub-version of the <code>VERSION</code> message. If a node connects to the wrong network, it will immediately be disconnected.</p>
<h2>New format of network message signatures </h2>
<p>We introduced a new signature format for Dash-specific network messages, read more <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/1936">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/1937">here</a>. We also introduced a new spork <code>SPORK_6_NEW_SIGS</code> which is going to be used to activate the new format after the network has finished the upgrade. Note that old pre-12.3 nodes won't be able to recognize and verify new signatures after <code>SPORK_6_NEW_SIGS</code> activates.</p>
<p>The old format is partly kept in the code to keep backwards compatibility. This code will be removed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2>Governance system improvements </h2>
<p>We do not use watchdogs since 12.2.x, instead we include all required information about sentinel into masternode pings. With this update we add some additional information and cover everything with a signature to ensure that masternode ping wasn't maleated by some intermediary node. All messages and logic related to watchdogs are completely removed now. We also improved proposal message format, as well as proposal validation and processing, which should lower network traffic and CPU usage. Handling of triggers was also improved slightly.</p>
<p><code>SPORK_13_OLD_SUPERBLOCK_FLAG</code> was removed now as it was unused since some time.</p>
<h2>PrivateSend improvements </h2>
<p>PrivateSend collaterals are no longer required to be N times of the PrivateSend fee (PSF), instead any input which is greater or equal 1 PSF but less or equal 4 PSF can be used as a collateral. Inputs that are greater or equal 1 PSF but strictly less than 2 PSF will be used in collaterals with OP_RETURN outputs. Note that such inputs will be consumed completely, with no change outputs at all. This should lower number of inputs wallet would need to take care of, improve privacy by eliminating the case where user accidentally merge small non-private inputs together and also decrease global UTXO set size.</p>
<p>It might feel that thanks to this change mixing fees are going to be slightly higher on average if have lots of such small inputs. However, you need to keep in mind that creating new PrivateSend collaterals cost some fee too and since such small inputs were not used at all you'd need more txes to create such collaterals. So in general, we believe average mixing fees should stay mostly the same.</p>
<p>There are also some other minor fixes which should also slightly improve mixing process.</p>
<h2>Additional indexes cover P2PK now </h2>
<p>Additional indexes like <code>addressindex</code> etc. process P2PK outputs correctly now. Note, that these indexes will not be re-built automatically on wallet update, you must reindex manually to update indexes with P2PK outputs.</p>
<h2>Support for pruned nodes in Lite Mode </h2>
<p>It is now possible to run a pruned node which stores only some recent blocks and not the whole blockchain. However this option is only available in so called Lite Mode. In this mode, Dash specific features are disabled, meaning that such nodes won't fully validate the blockchain (masternode payments and superblocks). PrivateSend and InstantSend functions are also disabled on such nodes. Such nodes are comparable to SPV-like nodes in terms of security and validation - it relies a lot on surrounding nodes, so please keep this in mind if you decide to use it for something.</p>
<h2>Default maximum block size </h2>
<p>We've changed the default maximum block size to 2MB. Such blocks were already allowed before, but the default setting for the maximum block size (which only affects miners) was kept in place until this version.</p>
<h2>RPC changes </h2>
<p>There are a few changes in existing RPC interfaces in this release:</p><ul>
<li><code>gobject count</code>, <code>masternode count</code> and <code>masternode list</code> will now by default return JSON formatted output; If you rely on the old output format, you can still specify an additional parameter for backwards compatibility (<code>all</code> for <code>count</code> and <code>status</code> for <code>list</code>);</li>
<li><code>masternodelist</code> has a few new modes: <code>daemon</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>sentinel</code>;</li>
<li><code>debug</code> rpc now requires categories to be separated via <code>+</code>, not <code>,</code> like before (e.g. <code>dash+net</code>);</li>
<li><code>getchaintips</code> now shows the block fork occurred in <code>forkpoint</code> field;</li>
<li><code>getrawmempool</code>'s has InstantSend-related info (<code>instantsend</code> and <code>instantlock</code>);</li>
<li><code>getgovernanceinfo</code> has new field <code>sentinelpingmaxseconds</code>;</li>
<li><code>getwalletinfo</code> now shows PrivateSend balance in <code>privatesend_balance</code> field;</li>
<li><code>sendrawtransaction</code> no longer bypasses transaction policy limits by default.</li>
<li><code>dumphdinfo</code> should throw an error when wallet isn't HD now</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a new RPC command <code>listaddressbalances</code>.</p>
<p>You can read about RPC changes brought by backporting from Bitcoin Core in following docs:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md#low-level-rpc-changes">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md#low-level-rpc-changes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#low-level-rpc-changes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Command-line options </h2>
<p>New cmd-line options:</p><ul>
<li>introduced in Dash Core 0.12.3.1: <code>allowprivatenet</code>, <code>bip9params</code>, <code>sporkaddr</code>, <code>devnet</code>;</li>
<li>backported from Bitcoin Core 0.13/0.14: <code>blockreconstructionextratxn</code>, <code>maxtimeadjustment</code>, <code>maxtipage</code>, <code>incrementalrelayfee</code>, <code>dustrelayfee</code>, <code>blockmintxfee</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <code>Help -&gt; Command-line options</code> in Qt wallet or <code>dashd --help</code> for more info.</p>
<h2>New Masternode Information Dialog </h2>
<p>You can now double-click on your masternode in <code>My Masternodes</code> list on <code>Masternodes</code> tab to reveal the new Masternode Information dialog. It will show you some basic information as well as software versions reported by the masternode. There is also a QR code now which encodes corresponding masternode private key (the one you set with mnprivkey during MN setup and NOT the one that controls the 1000 DASH collateral) which should make the process of pairing with mobile software allowing you to vote with your masternode a bit easier (this software is still in development).</p>
<h2>Testnet fixes </h2>
<p>While we've been in release preparation, a miner used his ASICs on testnet. This resulted in too many blocks being mined in a too short time. It revealed a few corner-case bugs in validation and synchronisation rules which we have fixed now. We've also backported a special testnet rule for our difficulty adjustment algorithm that allows to mine a low difficulty block on testnet when the last block is older than 5 minutes. This and the other fixes should stabilize our testnet in case of future ASIC uses on testnet.</p>
<h2>Using masternode lists for initial peers discovery </h2>
<p>We now use a recent masternode list to feed the hardcoded seed nodes list in Dash Core. This list was previously unmaintained as we fully relied on DNS based discovery on startup. DNS discovery is still used as the main discovery method, but the hardcoded seed list should now be able to serve as a proper backup in case DNS fails for some reason.</p>
<h2>Lots of backports, refactoring and bug fixes </h2>
<p>We backported many performance improvements and refactoring from Bitcoin Core and aligned most of our codebase with version 0.14. Most notable ones besides various performance and stability improvements probably are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#compact-block-support-bip-152">Compact Block support (BIP 152)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md#mining-transaction-selection-child-pays-for-parent">Mining transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent")</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.1.md#null-dummy-soft-fork">Null dummy soft fork (BIP 147, without SegWit)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#nested-rpc-commands-in-debug-console">Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#support-for-json-rpc-named-arguments">Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about all changes in Bitcoin Core 0.13 and 0.14 in following documents:</p><ul>
<li>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.13.0.md "release-notes-0.13.0.md";</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that some features were already backported earlier (per-UTXO fix, -assumevalid, GUI overlay etc.) and some were not backported at all (SegWit and feefilter, you can read more about why we did so <a href="https://blog.dash.org/segwit-lighting-rbf-in-dash-9536868ca861">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/2025">here</a>). The alert system was also kept in place for now. We are going to continue backporting the most notable fixes and improvements from Bitcoin Core versions 0.15 and 0.16 in future releases.</p>
<p>A lot of refactoring, code cleanups and other small fixes were done in this release again. We are going to continue making code more reliable and easier to review in future releases as well.</p>
