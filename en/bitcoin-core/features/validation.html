<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine a scientist reading about an experimental result and then
repeating the experiment for herself. Doing so allows her to <strong>trust
the result without having to trust the original scientists.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin Core checks each block of transactions it receives to ensure
that everything in that block is fully valid—allowing it to trust the
block without trusting the miner who created it.</p>

<p>This prevents miners from tricking Bitcoin Core users into accepting
blocks that violate the 21 million bitcoin limit or which break other
important rules.</p>

<p>Users of other wallets don’t get this level of security, so miners can
trick them into accepting fabricated transactions or hijacked block chains.</p>

<p>Why take that risk if you don’t have to? Bitcoin Core provides
the <strong>best possible security against dishonest miners</strong> along
with additional security against other easier attacks (see below
for details).</p>

      <p>This attack applies to <strong class="fgred">all Bitcoin wallets.</strong></p>

      <p>The attack works because powerful miners have the ability to rewrite the
block chain and replace their own transactions, allowing them to take
back previous payments.</p>

      <p>The cost of this attack depends on the percentage of total network hash
rate the attacking miner controls. The more centralized mining becomes,
the less expensive the attack for a powerful miner.</p>

      <p>In September 2013, someone used centralized mining pool GHash.io to
steal an estimated 1,000 bitcoins (worth $124,000 USD) from the gambling
site BetCoin.</p>

      <p>The attacker would spend bitcoins to make a bet.  If he won, he would
confirm the transaction.  If he lost, he would create a transaction
returning the bitcoins to himself and confirm that, invalidating the
transaction that lost the bet.</p>

      <p>By doing so, he gained bitcoins from his winning bets without losing
bitcoins on his losing bets.</p>

      <p>Although this attack was performed on unconfirmed transactions, the
attacker had enough hash rate (about 30%) to have profited from
attacking transactions with one, two, or even more confirmations.</p>

<p>Note that although all programs—including Bitcoin Core—are
vulnerable to chain rewrites, Bitcoin provides a defense mechanism: the
more confirmations your transactions have, the safer you are. <em>There is
no known decentralized defense better than that.</em></p>

<h2 id="help-protect-decentralization">Help Protect Decentralization</h2>

<p>The bitcoin currency only works when people accept bitcoins in exchange
for other valuable things. That means it’s the people accepting
bitcoins who give it value and who get to decide how Bitcoin should work.</p>

<p>When you accept bitcoins, you have the power to enforce Bitcoin’s rules,
such as preventing confiscation of any person’s bitcoins without access
to that person’s private keys.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>many users outsource their enforcement power</strong>. This
leaves Bitcoin’s decentralization in a weakened state where a handful of
miners can collude with a handful of banks and free services to change
Bitcoin’s rules for all those non-verifying users who outsourced their power.</p>

<table class="received_transactions center">
  <tr>
    <td class="center"><em>Users of Bitcoin banks</em><br /><strong class="fgred">Trust bankers</strong></td>

    <td class="center"><em>Users of P2P lightweight wallets</em><br /><strong class="fgred">Trust miners</strong></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="center"><em>Users of client lightweight wallets</em><br /> <strong class="fgred">Trust “free” services</strong></td>

    <td class="center"><em>Users of Bitcoin Core</em><br /><strong class="fggreen">Enforce the rules</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Unlike other wallets, <strong>Bitcoin Core <em>does</em> enforce the rules</strong>—so
if the miners and banks change the rules for their non-verifying
users, those users will be unable to pay full validation Bitcoin Core
users like you.</p>

<p>As long as there are many non-verifying users who want to be able to
pay Bitcoin Core users, miners and others know they can’t effectively
change Bitcoin’s rules.</p>

<p>But what if not enough non-verifying users care about paying Bitcoin
Core users? Then it becomes easy for miners and banks to take control of
Bitcoin, likely bringing to an end this 8 year experiment
in decentralized currency.</p>

<p>If you think <strong>Bitcoin should remain decentralized,</strong> the best thing you
can do is <a href="#do-you-validate">validate every payment you receive</a> using your own personal
full node such as Bitcoin Core.</p>

<p>We don’t know how many full validation users and business are needed,
but it’s possible that for each person or business who validates their
own transactions, Bitcoin can remain decentralized even if there are ten
or a hundred other non-verifying users. If this is the case, <strong>your
small contribution can have a large impact</strong> towards keeping Bitcoin
decentralized.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-validate">Do You Validate Your Transactions?</h2>

<p>Some people confuse <a href="/en/bitcoin-core/features/network-support">supporting the network</a> with
helping to <a href="/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation#help-protect-decentralization">protect Bitcoin’s decentralization</a>.</p>

<p>To <a href="/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation#how-validation-protects-your-bitcoins">improve your security</a> and help
protect decentralization, you must use a wallet that fully validates
received transactions. There are three ways to do that with Bitcoin
Core right now:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use the built-in wallet’s graphical mode.</strong> If you request payment
using the following screen in Bitcoin Core, your received
transactions will be fully validated.</p>

    <p><img src="/img/bitcoin-core/unique-invoice.png" alt="Bitcoin Core request payment" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Bitcoin Core as a trusted peer for certain lightweight
wallets.</strong> Learn more on the <a href="/en/bitcoin-core/features/user-interface#lightweight">user interface</a> page. If you use a secure connection to your personal
trusted peer <em>every time</em> you use the wallet, your received
transactions will be fully validated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use the built-in wallet’s CLI/API interface.</strong> This is meant for
power users, businesses, and programmers. The <a href="/en/bitcoin-core/features/user-interface">user interface</a> page provides an overview, the <a href="/en/full-node">installation
instructions</a> can help you get started, and
the <a href="/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs">RPC</a>/<a href="/en/developer-reference#http-rest">REST</a> documentation can help you find specific
commands. If you’re using <a href="/en/developer-reference#getnewaddress"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getnewaddress</code></a> to
create receiving addresses, your received transactions will be fully
validated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <div id="spv_wallets" title="SPV Wallets">
    <p><strong>Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)</strong> wallets are lightweight
  wallets that can verify whether or not a transaction is part of a block
  without downloading the 140 GB block chain. However,
  they cannot verify whether or not the transaction is actually valid.
  (Only full validation nodes like Bitcoin Core can do that.)</p>

    <p>Honest miners who only create blocks with valid transactions currently
  receive a 12.5 bitcoin subsidy.
  Dishonest miners who create blocks with invalid transactions don’t
  receive that subsidy, but they might still attempt to trick SPV
  wallets if they can steal more bitcoins than they would make honestly (or
  steal any amount of bitcoins from people they don’t like).</p>
