  <p>The illustration above shows a simplified version of a <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.
A <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." id="term-block" class="term">block</a> of one or more new transactions
is collected into the transaction data part of a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>.
Copies of each transaction are hashed, and the hashes are then paired,
hashed, paired again, and hashed again until a single hash remains, the
<a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." id="term-merkle-root" class="term">merkle root</a> of a <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle tree</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a> is stored in the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a>. Each <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> also
stores the hash of the previous <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block’s</a> <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">header</a>, chaining the <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>
together. This ensures a transaction cannot be modified without
modifying the <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> that records it and all following <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>.</p>

  <p>Transactions are also chained together. Dash <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> software gives
the impression that <a href="/en/glossary/denominations" title="Denominations of Dash value, usually measured in fractions of a dash but sometimes measured in multiples of a duff.  One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs." class="auto-link">duffs</a> are sent from and to <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>, but
Dash value really moves from transaction to transaction. Each
transaction spends the <a href="/en/glossary/denominations" title="Denominations of Dash value, usually measured in fractions of a dash but sometimes measured in multiples of a duff.  One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs." class="auto-link">duffs</a> previously received in one or more earlier
transactions, so the <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">input</a> of one transaction is the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> of a
previous transaction.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-transaction-propagation.svg" alt="Transaction Propagation" /></p>

  <p>A single transaction can create multiple <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, as would be
the case when sending to multiple <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>, but each <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> of
a particular transaction can only be used as an <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">input</a> once in the
<a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>. Any subsequent reference is a forbidden <a href="/en/glossary/double-spend" title="A transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion,  will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain." class="auto-link">double
spend</a>—an attempt to spend the same <a href="/en/glossary/denominations" title="Denominations of Dash value, usually measured in fractions of a dash but sometimes measured in multiples of a duff.  One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs." class="auto-link">duffs</a> twice.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">Outputs</a> are tied to <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." id="term-txid" class="term">transaction identifiers (TXIDs)</a>, which are the hashes
of signed transactions.</p>

  <p>Because each <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> of a particular transaction can only be spent once,
the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> of all transactions included in the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> can be categorized as either
<a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." id="term-utxo" class="term">Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)</a> or spent transaction <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>. For a
payment to be valid, it must only use <a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a> as <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a>.</p>

  <p>Ignoring <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transactions</a> (described later), if the value of a
transaction’s <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> exceed its <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a>, the transaction will be
rejected—but if the <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a> exceed the value of the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, any
difference in value may be claimed as a <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." id="term-transaction-fee" class="term">transaction

Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> containing that
transaction.
For example, in the illustration above, each transaction spends 10,000 <a href="/en/glossary/denominations" title="Denominations of Dash value, usually measured in fractions of a dash but sometimes measured in multiples of a duff.  One dash equals 100,000,000 duffs." class="auto-link">duffs</a>
fewer than it receives from its combined <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a>, effectively paying a 10,000

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> is collaboratively maintained by anonymous <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> on the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>, so
Dash requires that each <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> prove a significant amount of work was invested in
its creation to ensure that untrustworthy <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> who want to modify past <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> have
to work harder than honest <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> who only want to add new <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

<a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.</p>

  <p>Chaining <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> together makes it impossible to modify transactions included
in any <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> without modifying all following <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>. As a
result, the cost to modify a particular <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> increases with every new <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>
added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>, magnifying the effect of the <a href="/en/glossary/proof-of-work" title="A hash below a target value which can only be obtained, on average, by performing a certain amount of brute force work---therefore demonstrating proof of work." class="auto-link">proof of work</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/proof-of-work" title="A hash below a target value which can only be obtained, on average, by performing a certain amount of brute force work---therefore demonstrating proof of work." id="term-proof-of-work" class="term">proof of work</a> used in Dash
takes advantage of the apparently random nature of cryptographic hashes.
A good cryptographic hash algorithm converts arbitrary data into a
seemingly-random number. If the data is modified in any way and
the hash re-run, a new seemingly-random number is produced, so there is
no way to modify the data to make the hash number predictable.</p>

  <p>To prove you did some extra work to create a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>, you must create a
hash of the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> which does not exceed a certain value. For
example, if the maximum possible hash value is <span class="math">2<sup>256</sup> − 1</span>, you can prove that you
tried up to two combinations by producing a hash value less than <span class="math">2<sup>255</sup></span>.</p>

  <p>In the example given above, you will produce a successful hash on average every other try.
You can even estimate the probability
that a given hash attempt will generate a number below the <a href="/en/glossary/nbits" title="The target is the threshold below which a block header hash must be in order for the block to valid, and nBits is the encoded form of the target threshold as it appears in the block header." id="term-target" class="term">target</a>
threshold.
Dash assumes a linear probability that the lower it makes the <a href="/en/glossary/nbits" title="The target is the threshold below which a block header hash must be in order for the block to valid, and nBits is the encoded form of the target threshold as it appears in the block header." class="auto-link">target threshold</a>, the more hash attempts (on average) will need to be tried.</p>

  <p>New <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> will only be added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> if their hash is at
least as challenging as a <a href="/en/glossary/difficulty" title="How difficult it is to find a block relative to the difficulty of finding the easiest possible block. The easiest possible block has a proof-of-work difficulty of 1." id="term-difficulty" class="term">difficulty</a> value expected by the <a href="/en/glossary/consensus" title="When several nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain." class="auto-link">consensus</a> protocol.
Every <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>, the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> uses the <a href="/en/glossary/difficulty" title="How difficult it is to find a block relative to the difficulty of finding the easiest possible block.

seconds elapsed between generation of the first and last of those last 24 <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>.
The ideal value is 3600 (one hour).</p>

Only if you acquired a majority of the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network’s</a> hashing power

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> provides several easy-to-modify fields, such as a

for new transactions. Also, only the 80-byte <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> is hashed for
proof-of-work, so including a large volume of transaction data in
a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> does not slow down hashing with extra I/O, and adding additional

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

<a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> almost always do include additional transactions in order to

  <p>All transactions, including the <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transaction</a>, are encoded into
<a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> in binary rawtransaction format.</p>

  <p>The rawtransaction format is hashed to create the <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">transaction
identifier</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a>). From these <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txids</a>, the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.

<a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a> with one other <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a> and then hashing them together. If there are
an odd number of <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txids</a>, the <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a> without a partner is hashed with a
copy of itself.</p>

  <p>The resulting hashes themselves are each paired with one other hash and
hashed together. Any hash without a partner is hashed with itself. The
process repeats until only one hash remains, the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, if transactions were merely joined (not hashed), a
five-transaction <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.

  <p>As discussed in the <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">Simplified Payment Verification</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV</a>) subsection,
the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle tree</a> allows clients to verify for
themselves that a transaction was included in a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> by obtaining the
<a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a> from a <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> and a list of the intermediate hashes
from a full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peer</a>. The full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peer</a> does not need to be trusted: it is
expensive to fake <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block headers</a> and the intermediate hashes cannot be faked or
the verification will fail.</p>

  <p>For example, to verify transaction D was added to the
<a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>, an <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> only needs a copy of the C, AB, and EEEE hashes in addition to the
<a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a>; the client doesn’t need to know anything about any of the
other transactions. If the five transactions in this <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> were all at
the maximum size, downloading the entire <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> would require over
500,000 bytes—but downloading three hashes plus the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a>
requires only 140 bytes.</p>

  <p>Note: If identical <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txids</a> are found within the same <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>, there is a possibility that the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle tree</a> may collide with a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> with some or all duplicates removed due to how unbalanced <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle trees</a> are implemented (duplicating the lone hash).
Since it is impractical to have separate transactions with identical <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txids</a>, this does not impose a burden on honest software, but must be checked if the invalid status of a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> is to be cached;
otherwise, a valid <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

  <p>To maintain <a href="/en/glossary/consensus" title="When several nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain." class="auto-link">consensus</a>, all full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> validate <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> using the same
<a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a>. However, sometimes the <a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a> are changed to
introduce new features or prevent <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> abuse. When the new rules are
implemented, there will likely be a period of time when non-upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> follow the old rules and upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> follow the new rules,
creating two possible ways <a href="/en/glossary/consensus" title="When several nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain." class="auto-link">consensus</a> can break:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> following the new <a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a> is accepted by upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> but rejected by non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. For example, a new
transaction feature is used within a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>: upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> understand
the feature and accept it, but non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> reject it because
it violates the old rules.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> violating the new <a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a> is rejected by upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> but accepted by non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. For example, an abusive
transaction feature is used within a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>: upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> reject it
because it violates the new rules, but non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> accept it
because it follows the old rules.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In the first case, rejection by non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>, <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> software
which gets <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> data from those non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> refuses to
build on the same chain as <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> software getting data from upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. This creates permanently divergent chains—one for non-upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> and one for upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>—called a <a href="/en/glossary/hard-fork" title="A permanent divergence in the block chain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules." id="term-hard-fork" class="term">hard
fork</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-hard-fork.svg" alt="Hard Fork" /></p>

  <p>In the second case, rejection by upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>, it’s possible to keep
the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> from permanently diverging if upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> control a
majority of the hash rate. That’s because, in this case, non-upgraded
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> will accept as valid all the same <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> as upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>, so the
upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> can build a stronger chain that the non-upgraded <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>
will accept as the best valid <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>. This is called a <a href="/en/glossary/soft-fork" title="A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol  wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions  are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise  the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible." id="term-soft-fork" class="term">soft
fork</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-soft-fork.svg" alt="Soft Fork" /></p>

  <p>Although a <a href="/en/glossary/fork" title="When two or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain.  Typically occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time.  Can also happen as part of an attack." class="auto-link">fork</a> is an actual divergence in <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chains</a>, changes to the
<a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a> are often described by their potential to create either
a hard or <a href="/en/glossary/soft-fork" title="A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol  wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions  are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise  the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible." class="auto-link">soft fork</a>. For example, “increasing the <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> size requires a <a href="/en/glossary/hard-fork" title="A permanent divergence in the block chain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules." class="auto-link">hard
fork</a>.” In this example, an actual <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> <a href="/en/glossary/fork" title="When two or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain.  Typically occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time.  Can also happen as part of an attack." class="auto-link">fork</a> is not required—but it is
a possible outcome.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">Consensus rule</a> changes may be activated in various ways. During Bitcoin’s
first two years, Satoshi Nakamoto performed several <a href="/en/glossary/soft-fork" title="A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol  wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions  are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise  the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible." class="auto-link">soft forks</a> by just
releasing the backwards-compatible change in a client that began immediately
enforcing the new rule. Multiple <a href="/en/glossary/soft-fork" title="A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol  wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions  are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise  the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible." class="auto-link">soft forks</a> such as <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki" class="auto-link">BIP30</a> have
been activated via a flag day where the new rule began to be enforced at a
preset time or <a href="/en/glossary/block-height" title="The number of blocks preceding a particular block on a block chain. For example, the genesis block has a height of zero because zero block preceded it." class="auto-link">block height</a>. Such <a href="/en/glossary/fork" title="When two or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain.  Typically occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time.  Can also happen as part of an attack." class="auto-link">forks</a> activated via a flag day are known as
<a href="/en/glossary/uasf" title="A Soft Fork activated by flag day or node enforcement instead of miner signalling." id="term-uasf" class="term">User Activated Soft Forks</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/uasf" title="A Soft Fork activated by flag day or node enforcement instead of miner signalling." class="auto-link">UASF</a>) as
they are dependent on having sufficient users (<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>) to enforce the new rules
after the flag day.</p>

  <p>Later <a href="/en/glossary/soft-fork" title="A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol  wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions  are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise  the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible." class="auto-link">soft forks</a> waited for a majority of hash rate (typically 75% or 95%)
to signal their readiness for enforcing the new <a href="/en/glossary/consensus-rules" title="The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes." class="auto-link">consensus rules</a>. Once the signaling
threshold has been passed, all <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> will begin enforcing the new rules. Such
<a href="/en/glossary/fork" title="When two or more blocks have the same block height, forking the block chain.  Typically occurs when two or more miners find blocks at nearly the same time.  Can also happen as part of an attack." class="auto-link">forks</a> are known as <a href="/en/glossary/masf" title="A Soft Fork activated by through miner signalling." id="term-masf" class="term">Miner Activated Soft Forks</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/masf" title="A Soft Fork activated by through miner signalling." class="auto-link">MASF</a>)
as they are dependent on <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> for activation.</p>

  <p>Transactions let users spend satoshis. Each transaction is constructed
out of several parts which enable both simple direct payments and complex
transactions. This section will describe each part and
demonstrate how to use them together to build complete transactions.</p>

  <p>To keep things simple, this section pretends <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transactions</a> do
not exist. <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.

and they’re an exception to many of the rules listed below. Instead of

  <p>The figures below help illustrate how these features are used by
showing the workflow Alice uses to send Bob a transaction and which Bob
later uses to spend that transaction. Both Alice and Bob will use the
most common form of the standard Pay-To-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) transaction
type. <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." id="term-p2pkh" class="term">P2PKH</a> lets Alice spend satoshis to a typical Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>,
and then lets Bob further spend those satoshis using a simple
cryptographic <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-key-pair" title="A private key and its derived public key" class="auto-link">key pair</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-creating-p2pkh-output.svg" alt="Creating A P2PKH Public Key Hash To Receive Payment" /></p>

  <p>Bob must first generate a private/public <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-key-pair" title="A private key and its derived public key" id="term-key-pair" class="term">key pair</a> before Alice can create the
first transaction. Bitcoin uses the Elliptic Curve Digital <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">Signature</a> Algorithm (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA" class="auto-link">ECDSA</a>) with
the <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a> curve; <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a> <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." id="term-private-key" class="term">private keys</a> are 256 bits of random
data. A copy of that data is deterministically transformed into an <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a> <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." id="term-public-key" class="term">public

<a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> does not need to be stored.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">pubkey</a>) is then cryptographically hashed. This <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">pubkey hash</a> can
also be reliably repeated later, so it also does not need to be stored.
The hash shortens and obfuscates the <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a>, making manual
transcription easier and providing security against
unanticipated problems which might allow reconstruction of <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a>
from <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> data at some later point.</p>

  <p>Bob provides the <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">pubkey hash</a> to Alice. <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">Pubkey hashes</a> are almost always

through any medium, including one-way mediums which prevent the spender
from communicating with the receiver, and it can be further encoded
into another format, such as a QR code containing a <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code>

can create the first transaction. She creates a standard P2PKH

Bob’s hashed <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a>. These instructions are called the <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.

Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">scriptPubKey</a>.</p>

  <p>Alice broadcasts the transaction and it is added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.
The <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> categorizes it as an Unspent Transaction <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">Output</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXO</a>), and Bob’s

  <p>The script language is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29">Forth-like</a>
stack-based language deliberately designed to be stateless and not
Turing complete. Statelessness ensures that once a transaction is added
to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>, there is no condition which renders it permanently
unspendable. Turing-incompleteness (specifically, a lack of loops or
gotos) makes the script language less flexible and more predictable,
greatly simplifying the security model.</p>

violate another small set of rules enforcing good <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> behavior. This
is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">IsStandard()</code> test, and transactions which pass it are called
<a href="/en/glossary/standard-transaction" title="A transaction that passes Bitcoin Core's IsStandard() and IsStandardTx() tests. Only standard transactions are mined or broadcast by peers running the default Bitcoin Core software." class="auto-link">standard transactions</a>.</p>

would make adding new transaction features in the future more
difficult. For example, as described above, each transaction includes
a version number—if users started arbitrarily changing the version
number, it would become useless as a tool for introducing
backwards-incompatible features.</p>

(Called <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">nLockTime</a> in the Bitcoin Core source code.)
The <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">locktime</a> indicates the earliest time a transaction can be added to
the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">Locktime</a> allows signers to create time-locked transactions which will

  <p>If any of the signers change their mind, they can create a new

  <p>Care must be taken near the expiry time of a time lock. The <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">peer-to-peer
network</a> allows <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> time to be up to two hours ahead of
real time, so a <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">locktime</a> transaction can be added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it.

not created at guaranteed intervals, so any attempt to cancel a valuable

  <p>Previous versions of Bitcoin Core provided a feature which prevented

Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miner</a>, as explained in the <a href="/en/developer-guide#block-chain">block chain section</a>, and so it is
ultimately up to each <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miner</a> to choose the minimum <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a> they
will accept.</p>

  <p>There is also a concept of so-called “<a href="/en/glossary/high-priority-transaction" title="Transactions that don't have to pay a transaction fee because their inputs have been idle long enough to accumulated large amounts of priority.  Note: miners choose whether to accept free transactions." id="term-high-priority-transactions" class="term">high-priority transactions</a>” which spend satoshis that have not moved for a long time.</p>

  <p>In the past, these “priority” transaction were often exempt from the normal fee requirements. Before Bitcoin Core 0.12, 50 KB of each <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> would be reserved for these <a href="/en/glossary/high-priority-transaction" title="Transactions that don't have to pay a transaction fee because their inputs have been idle long enough to accumulated large amounts of priority.  Note: miners choose whether to accept free transactions." class="auto-link">high-priority transactions</a>, however this is now set to 0 KB by default.  After the priority area, all transactions are prioritized based on their fee per byte, with higher-paying transactions being added in sequence until all of the available space is filled.</p>

  <p>As of Bitcoin Core 0.9, a <a href="/en/glossary/minimum-relay-fee" title="The minimum transaction fee a transaction must pay (if it isn't a high-priority transaction) for a full node to relay that transaction to other nodes. There is no one minimum relay fee---each node chooses its own policy." id="term-minimum-fee" class="term">minimum fee</a> (currently 1,000 satoshis) has been required to
broadcast a transaction across the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>. Any transaction paying only the <a href="/en/glossary/minimum-relay-fee" title="The minimum transaction fee a transaction must pay (if it isn't a high-priority transaction) for a full node to relay that transaction to other nodes. There is no one minimum relay fee---each node chooses its own policy." class="auto-link">minimum fee</a>
should be prepared to wait a long time before there’s enough spare space
in a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> to include it. Please see the <a href="/en/developer-guide#verifying-payment">verifying payment section</a>
for why this could be important.</p>

  <p>Since each transaction spends Unspent Transaction <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">Outputs</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a>) and
because a <a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXO</a> can only be spent once, the full value of the included
<a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a> must be spent or given to a <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miner</a> as a <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a>.  Few
people will have <a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a> that exactly match the amount they want to pay,
so most transactions include a <a href="/en/glossary/change-address" title="An output in a transaction which returns satoshis to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees." class="auto-link">change output</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/change-address" title="An output in a transaction which returns satoshis to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees." id="term-change-output" class="term">Change outputs</a> are regular <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> which spend the surplus satoshis

described in the <a href="#avoiding-key-reuse">next subsection</a>, it is highly recommended that <a href="/en/glossary/change-address" title="An output in a transaction which returns satoshis to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees." class="auto-link">change

  <p>In a transaction, the spender and receiver each reveal to each other all
<a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> or <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> used in the transaction. This allows either
person to use the public <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> to track past and future
transactions involving the other person’s same <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> or <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>.</p>

  <p>If the same <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> is reused often, as happens when people use
Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> (hashed <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>) as static payment <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>,
other people can easily track the receiving and spending habits of that
person, including how many satoshis they control in known <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>.</p>

  <p>It doesn’t have to be that way. If each <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> is used exactly
twice—once to receive a payment and once to spend that payment—the
user can gain a significant amount of financial privacy.</p>

  <p>Even better, using new <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> or <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-unique-address" title="Address which are only used once to protect privacy and increase security" id="term-unique-address" class="term">unique

<a href="/en/glossary/change-address" title="An output in a transaction which returns satoshis to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees." class="auto-link">change outputs</a> can be combined with other techniques discussed later,
such as CoinJoin or <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-merge-avoidance" title="A strategy for selecting which outputs to spend that avoids merging outputs with different histories that could leak private information" class="auto-link">merge avoidance</a>, to make it extremely difficult to
use the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> by itself to reliably track how users receive and
spend their satoshis.</p>

  <p>Avoiding key reuse can also provide security against attacks which might
allow reconstruction of <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> from <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> (hypothesized) or
from <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">signature</a> comparisons (possible today under certain circumstances
described below, with more general attacks hypothesized).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Unique (non-reused) P2PKH and <a href="/en/glossary/p2sh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed script, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To Script Hash (P2SH). The script can be almost any valid pubkey script." class="auto-link">P2SH addresses</a> protect against the first
type of attack by keeping <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">ECDSA public keys</a> hidden (hashed) until the
first time satoshis sent to those <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> are spent, so attacks
are effectively useless unless they can reconstruct <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> in
less than the hour or two it takes for a transaction to be well
protected by the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Unique (non-reused) <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> protect against the second type of
attack by only generating one <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">signature</a> per <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>, so attackers
never get a subsequent <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">signature</a> to use in comparison-based attacks.
Existing comparison-based attacks are only practical today when
insufficient entropy is used in signing or when the entropy used
is exposed by some means, such as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack">side-channel attack</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>So, for both privacy and security, we encourage you to build your
applications to avoid <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> reuse and, when possible, to discourage
users from reusing <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>. If your application needs to provide a

  <p>None of Bitcoin’s <a href="/en/glossary/signature-hash" title="A flag to Bitcoin signatures that indicates what parts of the transaction the signature signs.  (The default is SIGHASH_ALL.)

Signature Scripts are called scriptSig in code." class="auto-link">signature script</a>, leaving
the door open for a limited denial of service attack called <a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="term" id="term-transaction-malleability">transaction
malleability</a>. The <a href="/en/glossary/signature-script" title="Data generated by a spender which is almost always used as variables to satisfy a pubkey script. Signature Scripts are called scriptSig in code." class="auto-link">signature script</a>
contains the <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">secp256k1 signature</a>, which can’t sign itself, allowing attackers to
make non-functional modifications to a transaction without rendering it
invalid. For example, an attacker can add some data to the <a href="/en/glossary/signature-script" title="Data generated by a spender which is almost always used as variables to satisfy a pubkey script. Signature Scripts are called scriptSig in code." class="auto-link">signature script</a>
which will be dropped before the previous <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> is processed.</p>

  <p>Although the modifications are non-functional—so they do not change
what <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a> the transaction uses nor what <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> it pays—they do
change the computed hash of the transaction. Since each transaction
links to previous transactions using hashes as a <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">transaction
identifier</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a>), a modified transaction will not have the <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a> its
creator expected.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a problem for most Bitcoin transactions which are designed to
be added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> immediately. But it does become a problem
when the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> from a transaction is spent before that transaction is
added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin developers have been working to reduce <a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="auto-link">transaction malleability</a>
among <a href="/en/glossary/standard-transaction" title="A transaction that passes Bitcoin Core's IsStandard() and IsStandardTx() tests. Only standard transactions are mined or broadcast by peers running the default Bitcoin Core software." class="auto-link">standard transaction</a> types, one outcome of those efforts is
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki">BIP 141: Segregated Witness</a>,
which is supported by Bitcoin Core but not activated. At present, new
transactions should not depend on
previous transactions which have not been added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> yet,
especially if large amounts of satoshis are at stake.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="auto-link">Transaction malleability</a> also affects payment tracking.  Bitcoin Core’s
<a href="/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs" class="auto-link">RPC</a> interface lets you track transactions by their <a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a>—but if that
<a href="/en/glossary/txid" title="An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction; specifically, the sha256d hash of the transaction." class="auto-link">txid</a> changes because the transaction was modified, it may appear that
the transaction has disappeared from the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>.</p>

  <p>Current best practices for transaction tracking dictate that a
transaction should be tracked by the transaction <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a>) it
spends as <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a>, as they cannot be changed without invalidating the
transaction.</p>

  <p>Best practices further dictate that if a transaction does seem to
disappear from the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> and needs to be reissued, that it be reissued
in a way that invalidates the lost transaction. One method which will
always work is to ensure the reissued payment spends all of the same
<a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> that the lost transaction used as <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a>.</p>

  <p>Contracts are
transactions which use the decentralized Bitcoin system to enforce financial
agreements.
Bitcoin contracts can often be crafted to minimize dependency on outside
agents, such as the court system, which significantly decreases the risk
of dealing with unknown entities in financial transactions.</p>

  <p>The following subsections will describe a variety of Bitcoin contracts
already in use. Because contracts deal with real people, not just
transactions, they are framed below in story format.</p>

  <p>Besides the contract types described below, many other contract types
have been proposed. Several of them are collected on the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts">Contracts
page</a> of the Bitcoin Wiki.</p>

  <p>Charlie-the-customer wants to buy a product from Bob-the-businessman,
but neither of them trusts the other person, so they use a contract to
help ensure Charlie gets his merchandise and Bob gets his payment.</p>

  <p>A simple contract could say that Charlie will spend satoshis to an
<a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> which can only be spent if Charlie and Bob both sign the <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">input</a>
spending it. That means Bob won’t get paid unless Charlie gets his
merchandise, but Charlie can’t get the merchandise and keep his payment.</p>

  <p>This simple contract isn’t much help if there’s a dispute, so Bob and
Charlie enlist the help of Alice-the-arbitrator to create an <a href="/en/glossary/escrow-contract" title="A transaction in which a spender and receiver place funds in a 2-of-2 (or other m-of-n) multisig output so that neither can spend the funds until they're both satisfied with some external outcome." id="term-escrow-contract" class="term">escrow

to an <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> which can only be spent if two of the three people sign the
<a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">input</a>.

Charlie’s money if there’s a problem, or Alice can arbitrate and decide

Then he hashes the
<a href="/en/glossary/redeem-script" title="A script similar in function to a pubkey script. One copy of it is hashed to create a P2SH address (used in an actual pubkey script) and another copy is placed in the spending signature script to enforce its conditions." class="auto-link">redeem script</a> to create a P2SH <a href="/en/glossary/redeem-script" title="A script similar in function to a pubkey script.

sees the payment get added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> and ships the merchandise.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the merchandise gets slightly damaged in transit. Charlie
wants a full <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a>, but Bob thinks a 10% <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> is sufficient. They
turn to Alice to resolve the issue. Alice asks for photo evidence from
Charlie along with a copy of the <a href="/en/glossary/redeem-script" title="A script similar in function to a pubkey script. One copy of it is hashed to create a P2SH address (used in an actual pubkey script) and another copy is placed in the spending signature script to enforce its conditions." class="auto-link">redeem script</a> Bob created and
Charlie checked.</p>

  <p>After looking at the evidence, Alice thinks a 40% <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> is sufficient,
so she creates and signs a transaction with two <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, one that spends 60%
of the satoshis to Bob’s <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> and one that spends the remaining
40% to Charlie’s <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a>.</p>

One copy of it is hashed to create a P2SH address (used in an actual pubkey script) and another copy is placed in the spending signature script to enforce its conditions." class="auto-link">redeem script</a>

  <p>Alice also works part-time moderating forum posts for Bob. Every time
someone posts to Bob’s busy forum, Alice skims the post to make sure it
isn’t offensive or spam. Alas, Bob often forgets to pay her, so Alice
demands to be paid immediately after each post she approves or rejects.
Bob says he can’t do that because hundreds of small payments will cost
him thousands of satoshis in <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fees</a>, so Alice suggests they use a
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-micropayment-channel" id="term-micropayment-channel" class="term">micropayment channel</a>.</p>

  <p>Bob asks Alice for her <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> and then creates two transactions.
The first transaction pays 100 millibitcoins to a <a href="/en/glossary/p2sh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed script, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To Script Hash (P2SH). The script can be almost any valid pubkey script." class="auto-link">P2SH output</a> whose
2-of-2 <a href="/en/glossary/multisig" title="A pubkey script that provides *n* number of pubkeys and requires the corresponding signature script provide *m* minimum number signatures corresponding to the provided pubkeys." class="auto-link">multisig</a> <a href="/en/glossary/redeem-script" title="A script similar in function to a pubkey script. One copy of it is hashed to create a P2SH address (used in an actual pubkey script) and another copy is placed in the spending signature script to enforce its conditions." class="auto-link">redeem script</a> requires <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">signatures</a> from both Alice and Bob.
This is the bond transaction.
Broadcasting this transaction would let Alice hold the millibitcoins
hostage, so Bob keeps this transaction private for now and creates a
second transaction.</p>

  <p>The second transaction spends all of the first transaction’s millibitcoins
(minus a <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a>) back to Bob after a 24 hour delay enforced
by <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">locktime</a>. This is the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction. Bob can’t sign the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction by himself, so he gives
it to Alice to sign, as shown in the
illustration below.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-micropayment-channel.svg" alt="Micropayment Channel Example" /></p>

  <p>Alice checks that the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction’s <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">locktime</a> is 24 hours in the
future, signs it, and gives a copy of it back to Bob. She then asks Bob
for the bond transaction and checks that the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction spends
the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> of the bond transaction. She can now broadcast the bond
transaction to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> to ensure Bob has to wait for the time lock
to expire before further spending his millibitcoins. Bob hasn’t actually
spent anything so far, except possibly a small <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a>, and
he’ll be able to broadcast the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction in 24 hours for a
full <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a>.</p>

  <p>Now, when Alice does some work worth 1 millibitcoin, she asks Bob to create
and sign a new version of the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction.  Version two of the
transaction spends 1 millibitcoin to Alice and the other 99 back to Bob; it does
not have a <a href="/en/glossary/locktime" title="Part of a transaction which indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain." class="auto-link">locktime</a>, so Alice can sign it and spend it whenever she
wants.  (But she doesn’t do that immediately.)</p>

  <p>Alice and Bob repeat these work-and-pay steps until Alice finishes for
the day, or until the time lock is about to expire.  Alice signs the
final version of the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction and broadcasts it, paying
herself and refunding any remaining balance to Bob.  The next day, when
Alice starts work, they create a new <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-micropayment-channel" class="auto-link">micropayment channel</a>.</p>

  <p>If Alice fails to broadcast a version of the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> transaction before
its time lock expires, Bob can broadcast the first version and receive a
full <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a>. This is one reason <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-micropayment-channel" class="auto-link">micropayment channels</a> are best suited to
small payments—if Alice’s Internet service goes out for a few hours
near the time lock expiry, she could be cheated out of her payment.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="auto-link">Transaction malleability</a>, discussed above in the Transactions section,
is another reason to limit the value of <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-micropayment-channel" class="auto-link">micropayment channels</a>.
If someone uses <a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="auto-link">transaction malleability</a> to break the link between the
two transactions, Alice could hold Bob’s 100 millibitcoins hostage even if she
hadn’t done any work.</p>

  <p>For larger payments, Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fees</a> are very low as a
percentage of the total transaction value, so it makes more sense to
protect payments with immediately-broadcast separate transactions.</p>

  <p>Alice is concerned about her privacy.  She knows every transaction gets
added to the public <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>, so when Bob and Charlie pay her, they
can each easily track those satoshis to learn what Bitcoin
<a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> she pays, how much she pays them, and possibly how many
satoshis she has left.</p>

  <p>Alice isn’t a criminal, she just wants plausible deniability about
where she has spent her satoshis and how many she has left, so she
starts up the Tor anonymity service on her computer and logs into an
IRC chatroom as “AnonGirl.”</p>

  <p>Also in the chatroom are “Nemo” and “Neminem.”  They collectively
agree to transfer satoshis between each other so no one besides them
can reliably determine who controls which satoshis.  But they’re faced
with a dilemma: who transfers their satoshis to one of the other two
pseudonymous persons first? The CoinJoin-style contract, shown in the
illustration below, makes this decision easy: they create a single
transaction which does all of the spending simultaneously, ensuring none
of them can steal the others’ satoshis.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-coinjoin.svg" alt="Example CoinJoin Transaction" /></p>

  <p>Each contributor looks through their collection of Unspent Transaction

They then each generate
a brand new <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> and give <a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXO</a> details and <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">pubkey hashes</a> to the
facilitator.  In this case, the facilitator is AnonGirl; she creates
a transaction spending each of the <a href="/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output" title="An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction." class="auto-link">UTXOs</a> to three equally-sized <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>.
One <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> goes to each of the contributors’ <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">pubkey hashes</a>.</p>

  <p>AnonGirl then signs her <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a> using <a href="/en/glossary/sighash-all" title="Default signature hash type which signs the entire transaction except any signature scripts, preventing modification of the signed parts." class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH_ALL</code></a> to ensure nobody can
change the <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">input</a> or <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> details.  She gives the partially-signed
transaction to Nemo who signs his <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a> the same way and passes it
to Neminem, who also signs it the same way.  Neminem then broadcasts
the transaction to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">peer-to-peer network</a>, mixing all of the millibitcoins in
a single transaction.</p>

  <p>As you can see in the illustration, there’s no way for anyone besides
AnonGirl, Nemo, and Neminem to confidently determine who received
which <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>, so they can each spend their <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> with plausible
deniability.</p>

  <p>Now when Bob or Charlie try to track Alice’s transactions through the
<a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>, they’ll also see transactions made by Nemo and
Neminem.  If Alice does a few more CoinJoins, Bob and Charlie might
have to guess which transactions made by dozens or hundreds of people
were actually made by Alice.</p>

  <p>The complete history of Alice’s satoshis is still in the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>,
so a determined investigator could talk to the people AnonGirl
CoinJoined with to find out the ultimate origin of her satoshis and
possibly reveal AnonGirl as Alice. But against anyone casually browsing
<a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> history, Alice gains plausible deniability.</p>

  <p>The CoinJoin technique described above costs the participants a small
amount of satoshis to pay the <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a>.  An alternative
technique, purchaser CoinJoin, can actually save them satoshis and
improve their privacy at the same time.</p>

  <p>AnonGirl waits in the IRC chatroom until she wants to make a purchase.
She announces her intention to spend satoshis and waits until someone
else wants to make a purchase, likely from a different merchant. Then
they combine their <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.  The outpoint references a previous output and the signature script allows spending it." class="auto-link">inputs</a> the same way as before but set the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>
to the separate merchant <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> so nobody will be able to figure
out solely from <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> history which one of them bought what from
the merchants.</p>

  <p>Since they would’ve had to pay a <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a> to make their purchases
anyway, AnonGirl and her co-spenders don’t pay anything extra—but
because they reduced overhead by combining multiple transactions, saving
bytes, they may be able to pay a smaller aggregate <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fee</a>,
saving each one of them a tiny amount of satoshis.</p>

  <p>Permitting receiving and spending of satoshis is the only essential
feature of <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> software—but a particular <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> program doesn’t
need to do both things.  Two <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> programs can work together, one
program distributing <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> in order to receive satoshis and
another program signing transactions spending those satoshis.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">Wallet</a> programs also need to interact with the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">peer-to-peer network</a> to
get information from the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> and to broadcast new transactions.
However, the programs which distribute <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> or sign transactions
don’t need to interact with the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">peer-to-peer network</a> themselves.</p>

  <p>This leaves us with three necessary, but separable, parts of a <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a>
system: a <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> distribution program, a signing program, and a
networked program.  In the subsections below, we will describe common
combinations of these parts.</p>

  <p>Note: we speak about distributing <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> generically. In many
cases, P2PKH or P2SH hashes will be distributed instead of <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>,
with the actual <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> only being distributed when the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>
they control are spent.</p>

  <p>The simplest <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> is a program which performs all three functions: it
generates <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a>, derives the corresponding <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>, helps
distribute those <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> as necessary, monitors for <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> spent to
those <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>, creates and signs transactions spending those
<a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, and broadcasts the signed transactions.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-wallets-full-service.svg" alt="Full-Service Wallets" /></p>

  <p>As of this writing, almost all popular <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a> can be used as
full-service <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>.</p>

  <p>The main advantage of full-service <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a> is that they are easy to use.
A single program does everything the user needs to receive and spend
satoshis.</p>

  <p>The main disadvantage of full-service <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a> is that they store the
<a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> on a device connected to the Internet.  The compromise of
such devices is a common occurrence, and an Internet connection makes it
easy to transmit <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> from a compromised device to an attacker.</p>

  <p>To help protect against theft, many <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> programs offer users the
option of encrypting the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> files which contain the <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a>.
This protects the <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> when they aren’t being used, but it
cannot protect against an attack designed to capture the encryption
key or to read the decrypted keys from memory.</p>

  <p>To increase security, <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> can be generated and stored by a

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-wallets-signing-only.svg" alt="Signing-Only Wallets" /></p>

The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent private key</a> and

  <p>The networked <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> then broadcasts the signed transactions to the

  <p>The offline <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> is so named because it is intended to be run on a

number of attack vectors. If this is the case, it is usually up to the
user to handle all data transfer using removable media such as USB

The offline device must be booted up whenever funds are to be spent, and
the user must physically copy data from the online device to the offline

The script can be almost any valid pubkey script." class="auto-link">P2SH addresses</a>) and nothing more.  There are two common ways to
design these minimalist <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-wallets-distributing-only.svg" alt="Distributing-Only Wallets" /></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Pre-populate a database with a number of <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> or <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a>, and
then distribute on request a <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> or <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.

the database entries. To <a href="/en/developer-guide#avoiding-key-reuse">avoid key reuse</a>, webservers should keep track
of used keys and never run out of <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>. This can be made easier
by using <a href="/en/glossary/parent-key" title="In HD wallets, a key used to derive child keys.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent public keys</a> as suggested in the next method.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use a <a href="/en/glossary/parent-key" title="In HD wallets, a key used to derive child keys.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent public key</a> to create <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child public keys</a>. To avoid key
reuse, a method must be used to ensure the same <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> isn’t
distributed twice. This can be a database entry for each key
distributed or an incrementing pointer to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-key-index" title="An index number used in the HD wallet formula to generate child keys from a parent key" class="auto-link">key
index</a> number.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Neither method adds a significant amount of overhead, especially if a
database is used anyway to associate each incoming payment with a
separate <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> for payment tracking. See the <a href="/en/developer-guide#payment-processing">Payment

  <p>Mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> format is a method for encoding a <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> in under 30 characters, enabling keys to be embedded in a small physical space, such as physical bitcoin tokens, and more damage-resistant QR codes.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The first character of mini keys is ‘S’.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In order to determine if a mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> is well-formatted, a question mark is added to the <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The SHA256 hash is calculated. If the first byte produced is a `00’, it is well-formatted. This key restriction acts as a typo-checking mechanism. A user brute forces the process using random numbers until a well-formatted mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> is produced.</p>

      <p>In order to derive the full <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>, the user simply takes a single SHA256 hash of the original mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>. This process is one-way: it is intractable to compute the mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> format from the derived key.</p>

  <p>Many implementations disallow the character ‘1’ in the mini <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> due to its visual similarity to ‘l’.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">ECDSA public keys</a> represent a point on a particular Elliptic
Curve (EC) defined in <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a>. In their traditional uncompressed form,
<a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> contain an identification byte, a 32-byte X coordinate, and
a 32-byte Y coordinate. The extremely simplified illustration below
shows such a point on the elliptic curve used by Bitcoin,
y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 7, over a field of
contiguous numbers.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-ecdsa-compressed-public-key.svg" alt="Point On ECDSA Curve" /></p>

  <p>(<a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">Secp256k1</a> actually modulos coordinates by a large prime, which produces a
field of non-contiguous integers and a significantly less clear plot,
although the principles are the same.)</p>

  <p>An almost 50% reduction in <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> size can be realized without
changing any fundamentals by dropping the Y coordinate. This is possible
because only two points along the curve share any particular X
coordinate, so the 32-byte Y coordinate can be replaced with a single
bit indicating whether the point is on what appears in the illustration
as the “top” side or the “bottom” side.</p>

  <p>No data is lost by creating these <a href="/en/glossary/compressed-public-key" title="An ECDSA public key that is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key." class="auto-link">compressed public keys</a>—only a small
amount of CPU is necessary to reconstruct the Y coordinate and access
the uncompressed <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a>. Both uncompressed and <a href="/en/glossary/compressed-public-key" title="An ECDSA public key that is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key." class="auto-link">compressed public
keys</a> are described in official <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a> documentation and supported by
default in the widely-used OpenSSL library.</p>

  <p>Because they’re easy to use, and because they reduce almost by half
the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> space used to store <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> for every spent <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>,
<a href="/en/glossary/compressed-public-key" title="An ECDSA public key that is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key." class="auto-link">compressed public keys</a> are the default in Bitcoin Core and are the
recommended default for all Bitcoin software.</p>

  <p>However, Bitcoin Core prior to 0.6 used uncompressed keys.  This creates
a few complications, as the hashed form of an uncompressed key is
different than the hashed form of a compressed key, so the same key
works with two different <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">P2PKH addresses</a>.   This also means that the key
must be submitted in the correct format in the <a href="/en/glossary/signature-script" title="Data generated by a spender which is almost always used as variables to satisfy a pubkey script. Signature Scripts are called scriptSig in code." class="auto-link">signature script</a> so it
matches the hash in the previous <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output’s</a> <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a>.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Bitcoin Core uses several different identifier bytes to
help programs identify how keys should be used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">Private keys</a> meant to be used with <a href="/en/glossary/compressed-public-key" title="An ECDSA public key that is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key." class="auto-link">compressed public keys</a> have 0x01
appended to them before being <a href="/en/glossary/base58check" title="The method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses.  Also used in other parts of Bitcoin, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format.  Not the same as other base58 implementations." class="auto-link">Base-58</a> encoded. (See the <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>
encoding section above.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Uncompressed <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> start with 0x04; <a href="/en/glossary/compressed-public-key" title="An ECDSA public key that is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key." class="auto-link">compressed public keys</a> begin
with 0x03 or 0x02 depending on whether they’re greater or less than
the midpoint of the curve.  These prefix bytes are all used in
official <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" class="auto-link">secp256k1</a> documentation.</p>

If an attacker gets a normal <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">parent

further-descended <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>, he can use the <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">chain code</a> to generate all

shown in the grandchild and great-grandchild generations of the illustration below.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-hd-cross-generational-key-compromise.svg" alt="Cross-Generational Key Compromise" /></p>

  <p>Perhaps worse, the attacker can reverse the normal <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child private key</a>

parent generations of the illustration above.  This means an attacker
who acquires an extended <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> and any <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> descended from
it can recover that <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key’s</a> <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> and all keys descended from
it.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">chain code</a> part of an extended <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> should be
better secured than standard <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> and users should be advised
against exporting even non-extended <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> to
possibly-untrustworthy environments.</p>

  <p>This can be fixed, with some tradeoffs, by replacing the the normal
key derivation formula with a hardened key derivation formula.</p>

  <p>The normal key derivation formula, described in the section above, combines
together the index number, the <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">parent chain code</a>, and the <a href="/en/glossary/parent-key" title="In HD wallets, a key used to derive child keys.

The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent
private key</a> to create the <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child private key</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-hd-private-parent-to-private-child.svg" alt="Creating Child Public Keys From An Extended Private Key" /></p>

  <p>The hardened formula, illustrated above, combines together the index
number, the <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">parent chain code</a>, and the <a href="/en/glossary/parent-key" title="In HD wallets, a key used to derive child keys.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent private key</a> to create
the data used to generate the <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">child chain code</a> and <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child private key</a>.
This formula makes it impossible to create <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child public keys</a> without
knowing the <a href="/en/glossary/parent-key" title="In HD wallets, a key used to derive child keys.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">parent private key</a>. In other words, parent extended <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public
keys</a> can’t create hardened <a href="/en/glossary/child-key" title="In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.  The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code." class="auto-link">child public keys</a>.</p>

  <p>Because of that, a <a href="/en/glossary/hardened-extended-key" title="A variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys. This prevents compromise of the chain code plus any private key from putting the whole wallet at risk." id="term-hardened-extended-private-key" class="term">hardened extended private
key</a> is much less
useful than a normal extended <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>—however, 
<a href="/en/glossary/hardened-extended-key" title="A variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys. This prevents compromise of the chain code plus any private key from putting the whole wallet at risk." class="auto-link">hardened extended private keys</a> create a firewall through which
multi-level key derivation compromises cannot happen. Because hardened
child extended <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a> cannot generate grandchild <a href="/en/glossary/chain-code" title="In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key" class="auto-link">chain codes</a> on
their own, the compromise of a parent extended <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> cannot be
combined with the compromise of a grandchild <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> to create
great-grandchild extended <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/hd-protocol" title="The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy. Wallets using the HD protocol are called HD wallets." class="auto-link">HD protocol</a> uses different index numbers to indicate
whether a normal or hardened key should be generated. Index numbers from
0x00 to 0x7fffffff (0 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1) will generate a normal key; index
numbers from 0x80000000 to 0xffffffff will generate a hardened key. To
make descriptions easy, many developers use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_%28symbol%29">prime symbol</a> to indicate
hardened keys, so the first normal key (0x00) is 0 and the first hardened
key (0x80000000) is 0´.</p>

  <p>(Bitcoin developers typically use the ASCII apostrophe rather than
the unicode prime symbol, a convention we will henceforth follow.)</p>

  <p>This compact description is further combined with slashes prefixed by
<em>m</em> or <em>M</em> to indicate hierarchy and key type, with <em>m</em> being a <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private
key</a> and <em>M</em> being a <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a>. For example, m/0’/0/122’ refers to the
123rd hardened private child (by index number) of the first normal child
(by index) of the first hardened child (by index) of the <a href="/en/glossary/master-chain-code-and-private-key" title="In HD wallets, the master chain code and master private key are the two pieces of data derived from the root seed." class="auto-link">master private
key</a>. The following hierarchy illustrates prime notation and hardened key
firewalls.</p>

which must be backed up precisely. To make it more convenient to use
non-digital backup methods, such as memorization or hand-copying, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" class="auto-link">BIP39</a>
defines a method for creating a 512-bit <a href="/en/glossary/hd-wallet-seed" title="A potentially-short value used as a seed to generate the master private key and master chain code for an HD wallet." class="auto-link">root seed</a> from a pseudo-sentence
(mnemonic) of common natural-language words which was itself created
from 128 to 256 bits of entropy and optionally protected by a password.</p>

  <p>The number of words generated correlates to the amount of entropy used:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Entropy Bits</th>
        <th>Words</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

  <p>The passphrase can be of any length.  It is simply appended to the mnemonic
pseudo-sentence, and then both the mnemonic and password are hashed
2,048 times using HMAC-SHA512, resulting in a seemingly-random 512-bit seed.  Because any
input to the hash function creates a seemingly-random 512-bit seed,
there is no fundamental way to prove the user entered the correct

The Bitcoin Core client <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> would create 100 <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a>/<a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> pairs automatically via a Pseudo-Random-Number Generator (PRNG) for later use.</p>

  <p>These unused <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a> are stored in a virtual “key pool”, with new
keys being generated whenever a previously-generated key was used,
ensuring the pool maintained 100 unused keys. (If the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> is
encrypted, new keys are only generated while the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> is unlocked.)</p>

  <p>This created considerable difficulty in backing up one’s keys, considering backups have to be run manually to save the newly-generated <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private keys</a>. If a new <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-key-pair" title="A private key and its derived public key" class="auto-link">key pair</a> set is generated, used, and then lost prior to a backup, the stored satoshis are likely lost forever. Many older-style mobile <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a> followed a similar format, but only generated a new <a href="/en/glossary/private-key" title="The private portion of a keypair which can create signatures that other people can verify using the public key." class="auto-link">private key</a> upon user demand.</p>

  <p>This <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> type is being actively phased out and discouraged from being used due to the backup hassle.</p>

  <p>Payment processing encompasses the steps spenders and receivers perform
to make and accept payments in exchange for products or services. The
basic steps have not changed since the dawn of commerce, but the
technology has. This section will explain how receivers and spenders
can, respectively, request and make payments using Bitcoin—and how
they can deal with complications such as <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refunds</a> and <a href="/en/developer-guide#rebilling-recurring-payments" title="Billing a spender on a regular schedule" class="auto-link">recurrent
rebilling</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-payment-processing.svg" alt="Bitcoin Payment Processing" /></p>

  <p>The figure above illustrates payment processing using Bitcoin from a
receiver’s perspective, starting with a new order. The following
subsections will each address the three common steps and the three
occasional or optional steps.</p>

  <p>It is worth mentioning that each of these steps can be outsourced by
using third party APIs and services.</p>

  <h3 id="pricing-orders">Pricing Orders</h3>
  <div class="subhead-links sourcefile" data-sourcefile="_includes/devdoc/guide_payment_processing.md"><a href="https://github.com/thephez/dash.org/edit/master/_includes/devdoc/guide_payment_processing.md">Edit</a>

  <p>Because of exchange rate variability between satoshis and national
currencies (<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" id="term-fiat" class="term">fiat</a>), many Bitcoin orders are priced in <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" class="auto-link">fiat</a> but paid
in satoshis, necessitating a price conversion.</p>

  <p>Exchange rate data is widely available through HTTP-based APIs provided
by currency exchanges. Several organizations also aggregate data from
multiple exchanges to create index prices, which are also available using
HTTP-based APIs.</p>

  <p>Any applications which automatically calculate order totals using exchange
rate data must take steps to ensure the price quoted reflects the
current general market value of satoshis, or the applications could
accept too few satoshis for the product or service being sold.
Alternatively, they could ask for too many satoshis, driving away potential
spenders.</p>

  <p>To minimize problems, your applications may want to collect data from at
least two separate sources and compare them to see how much they differ.
If the difference is substantial, your applications can enter a safe mode
until a human is able to evaluate the situation.</p>

  <p>You may also want to program your applications to enter a safe mode if
exchange rates are rapidly increasing or decreasing, indicating a
possible problem in the Bitcoin market which could make it difficult to
spend any satoshis received today.</p>

  <p>Exchange rates lie outside the control of Bitcoin and related
technologies, so there are no new or planned technologies which
will make it significantly easier for your program to correctly convert
order totals from <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" class="auto-link">fiat</a> into satoshis.</p>

  <p>Because the exchange rate fluctuates over time, order totals pegged to
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" class="auto-link">fiat</a> must expire to prevent spenders from delaying payment in the hope
that satoshis will drop in price. Most widely-used payment processing
systems currently expire their invoices after 10 to 20 minutes.</p>

  <p>Shorter expiration periods increase the chance the invoice will expire
before payment is received, possibly necessitating manual intervention
to request an additional payment or to issue a <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a>.   Longer
expiration periods increase the chance that the exchange rate will
fluctuate a significant amount before payment is received.</p>

  <h3 id="requesting-payments">Requesting Payments</h3>
  <div class="subhead-links sourcefile" data-sourcefile="_includes/devdoc/guide_payment_processing.md"><a href="https://github.com/thephez/dash.org/edit/master/_includes/devdoc/guide_payment_processing.md">Edit</a>

  <p>Before requesting payment, your application must create a Bitcoin
<a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>, or acquire an <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> from another program such as
Bitcoin Core.  Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> are described in detail in the
<a href="#transactions">Transactions</a> section. Also described in that section
are two important reasons to <a href="#avoiding-key-reuse">avoid using an address more than
once</a>—but a third reason applies especially to
<a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment requests</a>:</p>

  <p>Using a separate <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> for each incoming payment makes it trivial to
determine which customers have paid their <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment requests</a>.  Your
applications need only track the association between a particular <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment
request</a> and the <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> used in it, and then scan the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> for
transactions matching that <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>

  <p>The next subsections will describe in detail the following four
compatible ways to give the spender the <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> and amount to be paid.
For increased convenience and compatibility, providing all of these options in your
<a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment requests</a> is recommended.</p>

inconvenient—but it makes an effective fallback option.</p>

works with many mobile <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>, but it generally does not work with
web-based <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a> unless the spender installs a browser extension or

confusion and saves the spender from copying and pasting two separate
values. It also lets the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment request</a> provide some additional
information to the spender. An example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>bitcoin:mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN?amount=100
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Only the <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> is required, and if it is the only thing

the spender enter an amount. The amount specified is always in
decimal bitcoins (BTC).</p>

  <p>Two other parameters are widely supported. The
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-label" title="The label parameter of a bitcoin: URI which provides the spender with the receiver's name (unauthenticated)" id="term-label" class="term"><code class="highlighter-rouge">label</code></a> parameter is generally used to

<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-message" title="A parameter of bitcoin: URIs which allows the receiver to optionally specify a message to the spender" id="term-message" class="term"><code class="highlighter-rouge">message</code></a> parameter is generally used
to describe the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment request</a> to the spender. Both the label and the

are never added to the actual transaction, so other Bitcoin users cannot
see them. Both the label and the message must be <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">URI encoded</a>.</p>

  <p>All four parameters used together, with appropriate URI encoding, can be

  </div>

  <p>The URI scheme can be extended, as will be seen in the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a>
section below, with both new optional and required parameters. As of this

  <p>QR codes are a popular way to exchange <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URIs</a> in person, in
images, or in videos. Most mobile Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> apps, and some desktop
<a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>, support scanning QR codes to pre-fill their payment screens.</p>

  <p>The figure below shows the same <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a> code encoded as four
different <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-uri-qr-code" title="A QR code containing a bitcoin: URI" id="term-uri-qr-code" class="term">Bitcoin QR codes</a> at four
different error correction levels. The QR code can include the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-label" title="The label parameter of a bitcoin: URI which provides the spender with the receiver's name (unauthenticated)" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">label</code></a> and <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-message" title="A parameter of bitcoin: URIs which allows the receiver to optionally specify a message to the spender" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">message</code></a>
parameters—and any other optional parameters—but they were
omitted here to keep the QR code small and easy to scan with unsteady
or low-resolution mobile cameras.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-qr-code.svg" alt="Bitcoin QR Codes" /></p>

  <p>The error correction is combined with a checksum to ensure the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-uri-qr-code" title="A QR code containing a bitcoin: URI" class="auto-link">Bitcoin QR code</a>
cannot be successfully decoded with data missing or accidentally altered,
so your applications should choose the appropriate level of error
correction based on the space you have available to display the code.
Low-level damage correction works well when space is limited, and
quartile-level damage correction helps ensure fast scanning when
displayed on high-resolution screens.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin Core 0.9 supports the new <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." id="term-payment-protocol" class="term">payment protocol</a>. The <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a>
adds many important features to <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment requests</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" class="auto-link">X.509</a> certificates and SSL encryption to verify receivers’ identity
and help prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" class="auto-link">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Provides more detail about the requested payment to spenders.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Allows spenders to submit transactions directly to receivers without going
through the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">peer-to-peer network</a>. This can speed up payment processing and
work with planned features such as child-pays-for-parent <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fees</a>
and offline NFC or Bluetooth-based payments.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instead of being asked to pay a meaningless <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>, such as
“mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN”, spenders are asked to pay the
Common Name (CN) description from the receiver’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" class="auto-link">X.509</a> certificate, such
as “www.bitcoin.org”.</p>

  <p>To request payment using the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a>, you use an extended (but
backwards-compatible) <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a>.  For example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>bitcoin:mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN\
?amount=0.10\
&amp;label=Example+Merchant\
&amp;message=Order+of+flowers+%26+chocolates\
&amp;r=https://example.com/pay/mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>None of the parameters provided above, except <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-r-parameter" title="The payment request parameter in a bitcoin: URI" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></a>, are required for the
<a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a>—but your applications may include them for backwards
compatibility with <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> programs which don’t yet handle the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment
protocol</a>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-r-parameter" title="The payment request parameter in a bitcoin: URI" id="term-r-parameter" class="term"><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></a> parameter tells payment-protocol-aware <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> programs to ignore
the other parameters and fetch a <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a> from the URL provided.
The browser, QR code reader, or other program processing the URI opens
the spender’s Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> program on the URI.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-payment-protocol.svg" alt="BIP70 Payment Protocol" /></p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">Payment Protocol</a> is described in depth in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki" class="auto-link">BIP70</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0071.mediawiki" class="auto-link">BIP71</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0072.mediawiki" class="auto-link">BIP72</a>.
An example CGI program and description of all the parameters which can
be used in the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">Payment Protocol</a> is provided in the Developer Examples
<a href="/en/developer-examples#payment-protocol">Payment Protocol</a> subsection. In this
subsection, we will briefly describe in story format how the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">Payment
Protocol</a> is typically used.</p>

  <p>Charlie, the client, is shopping on a website run by Bob, the
businessman. Charlie adds a few items to his shopping cart and clicks
the “Checkout With Bitcoin” button.</p>

  <p>Bob’s server automatically adds the following information to its
invoice database:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The details of Charlie’s order, including items ordered and
shipping <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An order total in satoshis, perhaps created by converting prices in
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" class="auto-link">fiat</a> to prices in satoshis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An expiration time when that total will no longer be acceptable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> to which Charlie should send payment. Typically this
will be a P2PKH or <a href="/en/glossary/p2sh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed script, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To Script Hash (P2SH). The script can be almost any valid pubkey script." class="auto-link">P2SH pubkey script</a> containing a unique (never
before used) <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">secp256k1 public key</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>After adding all that information to the database, Bob’s server displays
a <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a> for Charlie to click to pay.</p>

  <p>Charlie clicks on the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a> in his browser. His browser’s URI
handler sends the URI to his <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> program. The <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> is aware of the
<a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">Payment Protocol</a>, so it parses the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-r-parameter" title="The payment request parameter in a bitcoin: URI" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code></a> parameter and sends an HTTP GET
to that URL looking for a <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a> message.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a> message returned may include private information, such as Charlie’s
mailing <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>, but the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> must be able to access it without using prior
authentication, such as HTTP cookies, so a publicly-accessible HTTPS URL
with a guess-resistant part is typically used. The
unique <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public key</a> created for the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment request</a> can be used to create
a unique identifier. This is why, in the example URI above, the <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a>
URL contains the <a href="/en/glossary/p2pkh-address" title="A Dash payment address comprising a hashed public key, allowing the spender to create a standard pubkey script that Pays To PubKey Hash (P2PKH)." class="auto-link">P2PKH address</a>:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">https://example.com/pay/mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN</code></p>

  <p>After receiving the HTTP GET to the URL above, the
<a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a>-generating CGI program on Bob’s webserver takes the
unique identifier from the URL and looks up the corresponding details in
the database. It then creates a <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message with the
following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The amount of the order in satoshis and the <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> to be paid.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A memo containing the list of items ordered, so Charlie knows what
he’s paying for.  It may also include Charlie’s mailing <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> so he can
double-check it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The time the <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message was created plus the time
it expires.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A URL to which Charlie’s <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> should send its completed transaction.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>That <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message is put inside a <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a> message.
The <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment request</a> lets Bob’s server sign the entire Request with the
server’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" class="auto-link">X.509</a> SSL certificate.  (The <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">Payment Protocol</a> has been designed
to allow other signing methods in the future.)  Bob’s server sends the
<a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment request</a> to Charlie’s <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> in the reply to the HTTP GET.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-btcc-payment-request.png" alt="Bitcoin Core Showing Validated Payment Request" /></p>

  <p>Charlie’s <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> receives the <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a> message, checks its <a href="/en/glossary/signature" title="A value related to a public key which could only have reasonably been created by someone who has the private key that created that public key. Used in Bitcoin to authorize spending satoshis previously sent to a public key." class="auto-link">signature</a>, and
then displays the details from the <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message to Charlie. Charlie
agrees to pay, so the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> constructs a payment to the <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a>
Bob’s server provided. Unlike a traditional Bitcoin payment, Charlie’s
<a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> doesn’t necessarily automatically broadcast this payment to the
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>. Instead, the <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> constructs a Payment message and sends it to
the URL provided in the <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message as an HTTP POST. Among
other things, the Payment message contains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The signed transaction in which Charlie pays Bob.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An optional memo Charlie can send to Bob. (There’s no guarantee that
Bob will read it.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> (<a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a>) which Bob can pay if he needs to
return some or all of Charlie’s satoshis.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Bob’s server receives the Payment message, verifies the transaction pays
the requested amount to the <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> provided, and then broadcasts the
transaction to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>. It also replies to the HTTP POSTed Payment
message with a PaymentACK message, which includes an optional memo
from Bob’s server thanking Charlie for his patronage and providing other
information about the order, such as the expected arrival date.</p>

  <p>Charlie’s <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> sees the PaymentACK and tells Charlie that the payment
has been sent. The PaymentACK doesn’t mean that Bob has verified
Charlie’s payment—see the Verifying Payment subsection below—but it does mean
that Charlie can go do something else while the transaction gets <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">confirmed</a>.
After Bob’s server verifies from the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> that Charlie’s
transaction has been suitably <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">confirmed</a>, it authorizes shipping
Charlie’s order.</p>

  <p>In the case of a dispute, Charlie can generate a cryptographically-proven
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-receipt" title="A cryptographically-verifiable receipt created using parts of a payment request and a confirmed transaction" id="term-receipt" class="term">receipt</a> out of the various signed or
otherwise-proven information.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentdetails" title="The PaymentDetails of the payment protocol which allows the receiver to specify the payment details to the spender" class="auto-link">PaymentDetails</a> message signed by Bob’s webserver proves Charlie
received an invoice to pay a specified <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> for a specified
number of satoshis for goods specified in the memo field.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> can prove that the <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> specified by
Bob was paid the specified number of satoshis.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> needs to be issued, Bob’s server can safely pay the
<a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a>-to <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> provided by Charlie.

  <p>Two or more transactions spending the same <a href="/en/glossary/input" title="An input in a transaction which contains three fields: an outpoint, a signature script, and a sequence number.

  <p>Once the transaction is included in a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

transaction, which is quite difficult. Using this system,
the Bitcoin protocol can give each of your transactions an updating confidence 
score based on the number of <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> which would need to be modified to replace

  <p>For example, <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction.

example, fraudsters may act differently from legitimate customers, letting 
savvy merchants manually flag them as high risk. Your program can provide a 
safe mode which stops automatic payment acceptance on a global or per-customer 
basis.</p>

  <p>Occasionally receivers using your applications will need to issue
<a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refunds</a>. The obvious way to do that, which is very unsafe, is simply
to return the satoshis to the <a href="/en/glossary/pubkey-script" title="A script included in outputs which sets the conditions that must be fulfilled for those duffs to be spent.  Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey script</a> from which they came.
For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Alice wants to buy a widget from Bob, so Bob gives Alice a price and
Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Alice opens her <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> program and sends some satoshis to that
<a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>. Her <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> program automatically chooses to spend those
satoshis from one of its unspent <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, an <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> corresponding to
the Bitcoin <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bob discovers Alice paid too many satoshis. Being an honest fellow,
Bob <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refunds</a> the extra satoshis to the mjSk… <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This seems like it should work, but Alice is using a centralized
multi-user <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">web wallet</a> which doesn’t give <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-unique-address" title="Address which are only used once to protect privacy and increase security" class="auto-link">unique addresses</a> to each user,
so it has no way to know that Bob’s <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> is meant for Alice.  Now the
<a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> is a unintentional donation to the company behind the centralized
<a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a>, unless Alice opens a support ticket and proves those satoshis
were meant for her.</p>

  <p>This leaves receivers only two correct ways to issue <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refunds</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If an <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a> was copy-and-pasted or a basic <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a> was used,
contact the spender directly and ask them to provide a <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a> was used, send the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> to the <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>
listed in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">refund_to</code> field of the Payment message.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: it would be wise to contact the
spender directly if the <a href="/en/developer-guide#issuing-refunds" title="A transaction which refunds some or all satoshis received in a previous transaction" class="auto-link">refund</a> is being issued a long time after the
original payment was made.
This allows you to ensure the user still has access to the key or keys
for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">refund_to</code> <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">address</a>.</p>

  <p>Many receivers worry that their satoshis will be less valuable in the
future than they are now, called foreign exchange (forex) risk. To limit
forex risk, many receivers choose to disburse newly-acquired payments
soon after they’re received.</p>

  <p>If your application provides this business logic, it will need to choose
which <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> to spend first.

which can lead to different results.</p>

earned, spent, and saved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A last-in-first-out (LIFO) algorithm spends newly acquired satoshis
while there’s still <a href="/en/glossary/double-spend" title="A transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion,  will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain." class="auto-link">double spend</a> risk, possibly pushing that risk on
to others. This can be good for the receiver’s balance sheet but
possibly bad for their reputation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A first-in-first-out (FIFO) algorithm spends the oldest satoshis
first, which can help ensure that the receiver’s payments always
confirm, although this has utility only in a few edge cases.</p>

  <p>When a receiver receives satoshis in an <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>, the spender can track
(in a crude way) how the receiver spends those satoshis. But the spender
can’t automatically see other satoshis paid to the receiver by other
spenders as long as the receiver uses <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-unique-address" title="Address which are only used once to protect privacy and increase security" class="auto-link">unique addresses</a> for each
transaction.</p>

  <p>However, if the receiver spends satoshis from two different spenders in
the same transaction, each of those spenders can see the other spender’s
payment.  This is called a <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-merge" title="Spending, in the same transaction, multiple outputs which can be traced back to different previous spenders, leaking information about how many satoshis you control" id="term-merge" class="term">merge</a>, and the more a receiver merges
<a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>, the easier it is for an outsider to track how many satoshis the
receiver has earned, spent, and saved.</p>

  <p><a href="/en/developer-guide#term-merge-avoidance" title="A strategy for selecting which outputs to spend that avoids merging outputs with different histories that could leak private information" id="term-merge-avoidance" class="term">Merge avoidance</a> means trying to avoid spending unrelated <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> in the
same transaction. For persons and businesses which want to keep their
transaction data secret from other people, it can be an important strategy.</p>

  <p>A crude <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-merge-avoidance" title="A strategy for selecting which outputs to spend that avoids merging outputs with different histories that could leak private information" class="auto-link">merge avoidance</a> strategy is to try to always pay with the
smallest <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> you have which is larger than the amount being
requested. For example, if you have four <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> holding, respectively,
100, 200, 500, and 900 satoshis, you would pay a bill for 300 satoshis
with the 500-satoshi <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>. This way, as long as you have <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>
larger than your bills, you avoid merging.</p>

  <p>More advanced <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-merge-avoidance" title="A strategy for selecting which outputs to spend that avoids merging outputs with different histories that could leak private information" class="auto-link">merge avoidance</a> strategies largely depend on enhancements
to the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a> which will allow payers to avoid merging by
intelligently distributing their payments among multiple <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>

  <p>There are two closely-related downsides to LIFO:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If you spend an <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> from one <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">unconfirmed transaction</a> in a second
transaction, the second transaction becomes invalid if <a href="/en/glossary/malleability" title="The ability of someone to change (mutate) unconfirmed transactions without making them invalid, which changes the transaction's txid, making child transactions invalid." class="auto-link">transaction
malleability</a> changes the first transaction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you spend an <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> from one <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">unconfirmed transaction</a> in a second
transaction and the first transaction’s <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a> is successfully <a href="/en/glossary/double-spend" title="A transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion,  will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain." class="auto-link">double
spent</a> to another <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">output</a>, the second transaction becomes invalid.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In either of the above cases, the receiver of the second transaction
will see the incoming transaction notification disappear or turn into an
error message.</p>

  <p>Because LIFO puts the recipient of secondary transactions in as much
<a href="/en/glossary/double-spend" title="A transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion,  will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain." class="auto-link">double-spend</a> risk as the recipient of the primary transaction, they’re
best used when the secondary recipient doesn’t care about the
risk—such as an exchange or other service which is going to wait for
six <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">confirmations</a> whether you spend old <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a> or new <a href="/en/glossary/output" title="An output in a transaction which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more duffs and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those duffs to be further spent." class="auto-link">outputs</a>.</p>

  <p>LIFO should not be used when the primary transaction recipient’s
reputation might be at stake, such as when paying employees. In these
cases, it’s better to wait for transactions to be fully verified (see
the <a href="/en/developer-guide#verifying-payment">Verification subsection</a> above) before using them to make payments.</p>

  <p>FIFO does have a small advantage when it comes to <a href="/en/glossary/transaction-fee" title="The amount remaining when the value of all outputs in a transaction are subtracted from all inputs in a transaction; the fee is paid to the miner who includes that transaction in a block." class="auto-link">transaction fees</a>, as

significant advantage.</p>

  <p>The only practical use of FIFO is by receivers who spend all or most
of their income within a few <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>, and who want to reduce the
chance of their payments becoming accidentally invalid. For example,
a receiver who holds each payment for six <a href="/en/glossary/confirmation-score" title="A score indicating the number of blocks on the best block chain that would need to be modified to remove or modify a particular transaction. A confirmed transaction has a confirmation score of one or higher." class="auto-link">confirmations</a>, and then
spends 100% of <a href="/en/developer-guide#verifying-payment" title="Payments which the receiver believes won't be double spent" class="auto-link">verified payments</a> to vendors and a savings account on
a bi-hourly schedule.</p>

  <h3 id="rebilling-recurring-payments">Rebilling Recurring Payments</h3>

  <p>Automated recurring payments are not possible with decentralized Bitcoin
<a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallets</a>. Even if a <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> supported automatically sending non-reversible
payments on a regular schedule, the user would still need to start the
program at the appointed time, or leave it running all the time
unprotected by encryption.</p>

  <p>This means automated recurring Bitcoin payments can only be made from a
centralized server which handles satoshis on behalf of its spenders. In
practice, receivers who want to set prices in <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-fiat" title="National currencies such as the dollar or euro" class="auto-link">fiat</a> terms must also let
the same centralized server choose the appropriate exchange rate.</p>

  <p>Non-automated rebilling can be managed by the same mechanism used before
credit-card recurring payments became common: contact the spender and
ask them to pay again—for example, by sending them a <a href="/en/developer-examples#term-paymentrequest" title="The PaymentRequest of the payment protocol which contains and allows signing of the PaymentDetails" class="auto-link">PaymentRequest</a>
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-bitcoin-uri" title="A URI which allows receivers to encode payment details so spenders don't have to manually enter addresses and other details" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin:</code> URI</a> in an HTML email.</p>

  <p>In the future, extensions to the <a href="/en/glossary/payment-protocol" title="The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers." class="auto-link">payment protocol</a> and new <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a>
features may allow some <a href="/en/glossary/wallet" title="Software that stores private keys and monitors the block chain (sometimes as a client of a server that does the processing) to allow users to spend and receive duffs." class="auto-link">wallet</a> programs to manage a list of recurring
transactions. The spender will still need to start the program on a
regular basis and authorize payment—but it should be easier and more
secure for the spender than clicking an emailed invoice, increasing the
chance receivers get paid on time.</p>

  <p>The first and most secure model is the one followed by Bitcoin Core, also known as a “thick” or “full chain” client.

Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> during the initial syncing process and then requests transactions from full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> as needed. This scales linearly with the <a href="/en/glossary/block-height" title="The number of blocks preceding a particular block on a block chain. For example, the genesis block has a height of zero because zero block preceded it." class="auto-link">height</a> of the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> at only 80 bytes per <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a>, or up to 4.2MB per year, regardless of total <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> size.</p>

  <p>As described in the white paper, the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.

The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> that the transaction in question is embedded in a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>. This does not guarantee validity of the transactions that are embedded. Instead it demonstrates the amount of work required to perform a <a href="/en/glossary/double-spend" title="A transaction that uses the same input as an already broadcast transaction. The attempt of duplication, deceit, or conversion,  will be adjudicated when only one of the transactions is recorded in the blockchain." class="auto-link">double-spend</a> attack.</p>

  <p>If implemented naively, an <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> has a few important weaknesses.</p>

  <p>First, while the <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> can not be easily fooled into thinking a transaction is in a <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> when it is not, the reverse is not true. A <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">full node</a> can simply lie by omission, leading an <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> to believe a transaction has not occurred. This can be considered a form of Denial of Service. One mitigation strategy is to connect to a number of full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>, and send the requests to each <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>. However this can be defeated by <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> partitioning or Sybil attacks, since identities are essentially free, and can be bandwidth intensive. Care must be taken to ensure the client is not cut off from honest <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>.</p>

  <p>Second, the <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> only requests transactions from full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> corresponding to keys it owns. If the <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> downloads all <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> and then discards unneeded ones, this can be extremely bandwidth intensive. If they simply ask full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> for <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> with specific transactions, this allows full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> a complete view of the public <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> that correspond to the user. This is a large privacy leak, and allows for tactics such as denial of service for clients, users, or <a href="/en/glossary/address" title="A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address.  Currently the most common way users exchange payment information." class="auto-link">addresses</a> that are disfavored by those running full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>, as well as trivial linking of funds. A client could simply spam many fake transaction requests, but this creates a large strain on the <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a>, and can end up defeating the purpose of <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">thin clients</a> altogether.</p>

  <p>To mitigate the latter issue, <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filters</a> have been implemented as a method of obfuscation and compression of <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

  <p>A <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test membership of an element. The data structure achieves great data compression at the expense of a prescribed false positive rate.</p>

  <p>A <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> starts out as an array of n bits all set to 0. A set of k random hash functions are chosen, each of which output a single integer between the range of 1 and n.</p>

  <p>When adding an element to the <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a>, the element is hashed k times separately, and for each of the k outputs, the corresponding <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> bit at that index is set to 1.</p>

  <p>Querying of the <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> is done by using the same hash functions as before. If all k bits accessed in the <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">bloom filter</a> are set to 1, this demonstrates with high probability that the element lies in the set. Clearly, the k indices could have been set to 1 by the addition of a combination of other elements in the domain, but the parameters allow the user to choose the acceptable false positive rate.</p>

  <p>Removal of elements can only be done by scrapping the <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">bloom filter</a> and re-creating it from scratch.</p>

  <p>Rather than viewing the false positive rates as a liability, it is used to create a tunable parameter that represents the desired privacy level and bandwidth trade-off. A <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> creates their <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> and sends it to a <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">full node</a> using the message <code class="highlighter-rouge">filterload</code>, which sets the filter for which transactions are desired. The command <code class="highlighter-rouge">filteradd</code> allows addition of desired data to the filter without needing to send a totally new <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">filterclear</code> allows the connection to revert to standard <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> discovery mechanisms. If the filter has been loaded, then full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> will send a modified form of <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

The <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-block" title="A partial merkle tree connecting transactions matching a bloom filter to the merkle root of a block." class="auto-link">merkle block</a> is simply the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> with the merkle branch associated with the set <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a>.</p>

  <p>An <a href="/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification" title="A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block.  The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin clients." class="auto-link">SPV client</a> can not only add transactions as elements to the filter, but also <a href="/en/glossary/public-key" title="The public portion of a keypair which can be used to verify signatures made with the private portion of the keypair." class="auto-link">public keys</a>, data from <a href="/en/glossary/signature-script" title="Data generated by a spender which is almost always used as variables to satisfy a pubkey script.

Data for fulfilling the conditions can be provided in a signature script. Pubkey Scripts are called a scriptPubKey in code." class="auto-link">pubkey scripts</a>, and more. This enables P2SH transaction finding.</p>

  <p>If a user is more privacy-conscious, he can set the <a href="/en/glossary/bloom-filter" title="A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes." class="auto-link">Bloom filter</a> to include more false positives, at the expense of extra bandwidth used for transaction discovery. If a user is on a tight bandwidth budget, he can set the false-positive rate to low, knowing that this will allow full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> a clear view of what transactions are associated with his client.</p>

  <p>When started for the first time, programs don’t know the IP
addresses of any active full <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. In order to discover some IP

  <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seeds</a> are maintained by Bitcoin community members: some of them
provide dynamic <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seed</a> servers which automatically get IP addresses
of active <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> by scanning the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>; others provide static <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS
seeds</a> that are updated manually and are more likely to provide IP
addresses for inactive <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. In either case, <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> are added to the
<a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seed</a> if they run on the default Bitcoin ports of 8333 for <a href="/en/glossary/mainnet" title="The original and main network for Dash transactions, where duffs have real economic value." class="auto-link">mainnet</a>

  <p><a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seed</a> results are not authenticated and a malicious seed operator or
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" class="auto-link">man-in-the-middle</a> attacker can return only IP addresses of
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> controlled by the attacker, isolating a program on the attacker’s
own <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> and allowing the attacker to feed it bogus transactions and
<a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a>.  For this reason, programs should not rely on <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seeds</a>
exclusively.</p>

  <p>Once a program has connected to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>, its <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> can begin to send
it <code class="highlighter-rouge">addr</code>
(address) messages with the IP addresses and port numbers of
other <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> on the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>, providing a fully decentralized method of
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peer</a> discovery. Bitcoin Core keeps a record of known <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> in a
persistent on-disk database which usually allows it to connect directly
to those <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> on subsequent startups without having to use <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seeds</a>.</p>

  <p>However, <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> often leave the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> or change IP addresses, so
programs may need to make several different connection attempts at
startup before a successful connection is made. This can add a
significant delay to the amount of time it takes to connect to the
<a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>, forcing a user to wait before sending a transaction or checking
the status of payment.</p>

  <p>To avoid this possible delay, <a href="http://bitcoinj.github.io" class="auto-link">BitcoinJ</a> always uses dynamic <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seeds</a> to
get IP addresses for <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> believed to be currently active.
Bitcoin Core also tries to strike a balance between minimizing delays
and avoiding unnecessary <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seed</a> use: if Bitcoin Core has entries in
its <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peer</a> database, it spends up to 11 seconds attempting to connect to
at least one of them before falling back to seeds; if a connection is
made within that time, it does not query any seeds.</p>

  <p>Both Bitcoin Core and <a href="http://bitcoinj.github.io" class="auto-link">BitcoinJ</a> also include a hardcoded list of IP
addresses and port numbers to several dozen <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> which were active
around the time that particular version of the software was first
released. Bitcoin Core will start attempting to connect to these <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>
if none of the <a href="/en/glossary/dns-seed" title="A DNS server which returns IP addresses of full nodes on the Dash network to assist in peer discovery." class="auto-link">DNS seed</a> servers have responded to a query within 60
seconds, providing an automatic fallback option.</p>

  <p>As a manual fallback option, Bitcoin Core also provides several
command-line connection options, including the ability to get a list of
<a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> from a specific <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> by IP address, or to make a persistent
connection to a specific <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> by IP address.  See the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-help</code> text for
details.  <a href="http://bitcoinj.github.io" class="auto-link">BitcoinJ</a> can be programmed to do the same thing.</p>

  <p>The primary advantage of <a href="/en/glossary/blocks-first-sync" title="Synchronizing the block chain by downloading each block from a peer and then validating it." class="auto-link">blocks-first IBD</a> is its simplicity. The primary
disadvantage is that the <a href="/en/glossary/initial-block-download" title="The process used by a new node (or long-offline node) to download a large number of blocks to catch up to the tip of the best block chain." class="auto-link">IBD</a> <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> relies on a single sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> for all
of its downloading. This has several implications:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Speed Limits:</strong> All requests are made to the sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>, so if the
sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> has limited upload bandwidth, the <a href="/en/glossary/initial-block-download" title="The process used by a new node (or long-offline node) to download a large number of blocks to catch up to the tip of the best block chain." class="auto-link">IBD</a> <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> will have slow
download speeds.  Note: if the sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> goes offline, Bitcoin Core
will continue downloading from another <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>—but it will still only
download from a single sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> at a time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Download Restarts:</strong> The sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> can send a non-best (but
otherwise valid) <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a> to the <a href="/en/glossary/initial-block-download" title="The process used by a new node (or long-offline node) to download a large number of blocks to catch up to the tip of the best block chain." class="auto-link">IBD</a> <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>.

over again from a different <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>. Bitcoin Core ships with several
<a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it.

its download earlier in the process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Disk Fill Attacks:</strong> Closely related to the download restarts, if
the sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> sends a non-best (but otherwise valid) <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain." class="auto-link">block chain</a>, the
chain will be stored on disk, wasting space and possibly filling up
the disk drive with useless data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>High Memory Use:</strong> Whether maliciously or by accident, the sync <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a>
can send <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">blocks</a> out of order, creating <a href="/en/glossary/orphan-block" title="Blocks whose parent block has not been processed by the local node, so they can't be fully validated yet." class="auto-link">orphan blocks</a> which can’t be
validated until their parents have been received and validated.
<a href="/en/glossary/orphan-block" title="Blocks whose parent block has not been processed by the local node, so they can't be fully validated yet." class="auto-link">Orphan blocks</a> are stored in memory while they await validation,
which may lead to high memory use.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

The

that it has no more <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">headers</a> to offer. As of this writing, <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">headers</a>
sync can be completed in fewer than 200 round trips, or about 32 MB

Bitcoin Core stores them in non-persistent memory, calling them a memory

  <p>Dash Core performs full masternode synchronization as required. There are
several conditions that initiate a start/restart the sync process:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Initial startup of Dash Core</li>
    <li>More than 60 minutes have passed since the last activation</li>
    <li>A failure occurred during the last sync attempt (after a 1 minute cooldown before sync restarts)</li>
    <li>Issuing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">mnsync reset</code> <a href="/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs" class="auto-link">RPC</a> command</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="ongoing-masternode-sync">Ongoing Masternode Sync</h4>

  <p>Once a masternode completes an initial full sync, continuing synchronization is
maintained by the exchange of P2P messages with other <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a>. This diagram shows
an overview of the messages exchanged to keep the masternode list, masternode
payments, and governance objects synchronized between masternodes.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/dev/en-masternode-sync-ongoing.svg" alt="Masternode Sync (Ongoing)" /></p>

  <p><strong>Recurring Ping</strong></p>

  <p>Each masternode issues a ping (<a href="/en/developer-reference#mnp" title="A P2P protocol message sent by masternodes every few minutes to ping the network with a message that propagates across the whole network" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">mnp</code> message</a>) periodically to notify the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>
that it is still online. Masternodes that do not issue a ping for 3 hours will
be put into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MASTERNODE_NEW_START_REQUIRED</code> state and will need to issue a
masternode announce (<a href="/en/developer-reference#mnb" title="A P2P protocol message used to describe the masternode entry and how to validate messages from it" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">mnb</code> message</a>).</p>

  <p><strong>Masternode List</strong></p>

  <p>After the initial masternode list has been received, it is kept current by a
combination of the periodic <a href="/en/developer-reference#mnp" title="A P2P protocol message sent by masternodes every few minutes to ping the network with a message that propagates across the whole network" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">mnp</code> messages</a> received from other masternodes,

to verify that other masternodes are valid.</p>

  <p>Also, <a href="/en/developer-reference#dseg" title="A P2P network message which requests either the entire masternode list or a specific masternode entry" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">dseg</code> messages</a> can be sent to request masternode info when messages are
received that have been signed by an unrecognized masternode (most masternode/governance
messages include a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vin</code> value that can be used to verify the masternode’s
unspent 1000 Dash).</p>

  <p>Unsynchronized <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">peers</a> may send a <a href="/en/developer-reference#dseg" title="A P2P network message which requests either the entire masternode list or a specific masternode entry" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">dseg</code> message</a> to request the entire masternode list.</p>

  <p><strong>Masternode Payment</strong></p>

  <p>After the initial masternode payment synchronization, payment information is
kept current via the <a href="/en/developer-reference#mnw" title="A P2P protocol message used to pick the next winning masternode (payee)" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">mnw</code> messages</a> relayed on the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a>.

  <p><strong>Governance</strong></p>

  <p>After the initial governance synchronization, governance information is kept
current by the <a href="/en/developer-reference#govobj" title="A P2P network message used to send governance objects (proposals, etc.)" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govobj</code> messages</a> and <a href="/en/developer-reference#govobjvote" title="A P2P network message used to send governance object votes" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govobjvote</code> messages</a> relayed on the

  <h4 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h4>

  <p>Dash Core synchronizes the governance system via the Masternode <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> as the
last stage of the Masternode sync process (following the sync of sporks, the
Masternode list, and Masternode payments).</p>

  <p>The <a href="/en/developer-reference#govsync" title="A P2P network message used to synchronize governance objects" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govsync</code> message</a> initiates a sync of the governance system. Masternodes
ignore this request if they are not fully synced.</p>

  <p>There are two distinct stages of governance sync:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Initial request (object sync) - requests the governance objects only via a
<a href="/en/developer-reference#govsync" title="A P2P network message used to synchronize governance objects" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govsync</code> message</a> sent with a hash of all zeros.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Follow up request(s) (vote sync) - request governance object votes for a
specific object via a <a href="/en/developer-reference#govsync" title="A P2P network message used to synchronize governance objects" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govsync</code> message</a> containing the hash of the object. One
message is required for each object. Dash Core periodically (~ every 6 seconds)
sends messages to connected <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">nodes</a> until all the governance objects have been
synchronized.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Dash Core limits how frequently the first type of sync (object sync) can be
requested. Frequent requests will result in the node being banned.</code></pre></figure>

  <p>Masternodes respond to the <a href="/en/developer-reference#govsync" title="A P2P network message used to synchronize governance objects" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">govsync</code> message</a> with several items:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>First, the Masternode sends one <a href="/en/developer-reference#ssc" title="A P2P network message used to track the sync status of masternode objects ()" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssc</code> message</a> (Sync Status Count) for <code class="highlighter-rouge">govobj</code>
objects and one for <code class="highlighter-rouge">govobjvote</code> objects. These messages indicate how many
<a href="/en/glossary/inventory" title="A data type identifier and a hash; used to identify transactions, blocks, and objects available for download through the Dash P2P network." class="auto-link">inventory</a> items will be sent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Second, the Masternode sends <a href="/en/developer-reference#inv" title="A P2P protocol message used to send inventories of transactions and blocks known to the transmitting peer" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">inv</code> messages</a> for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">govobj</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">govobjvote</code>
objects.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once the syncing <a href="/en/glossary/node" title="A computer that connects to the Dash network." class="auto-link">node</a> receives the counts and <a href="/en/glossary/inventory" title="A data type identifier and a hash; used to identify transactions, blocks, and objects available for download through the Dash P2P network." class="auto-link">inventories</a>, it may request any
<code class="highlighter-rouge">govobj</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">govobjvote</code> objects from the masternode via a <a href="/en/developer-reference#getdata" title="A P2P protocol message used to request one or more transactions, blocks, or merkle blocks" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getdata</code> message</a>.</p>

difficulty</a>. This causes the <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> hardware to return many <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block headers</a>

sends these to the <a href="/en/developer-guide#term-network" title="The Dash P2P network which broadcasts transactions and blocks" class="auto-link">network</a> to be added to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-chain" title="A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it.

are paid to the <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> pool. The <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> pool pays out a portion of

average to create a successful <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.

  <p>Like all <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoind</code> <a href="/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs" class="auto-link">RPCs</a>, <a href="/en/developer-reference#getblocktemplate" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblocktemplate</code></a> is sent over HTTP.

ensure they get the most recent work, most <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">HTTP longpoll</a> to

  <p>A widely used alternative to <a href="/en/developer-reference#getblocktemplate" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblocktemplate</code></a> is the <a href="http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining">Stratum mining
protocol</a>. Stratum focuses on giving <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> the minimal information they
need to construct <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block headers</a> on their own:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The information necessary to construct a <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transaction</a>
paying the pool.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The parts of the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle tree</a> which need to be re-hashed to
create a new <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a> when the <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transaction</a> is
updated with a new extra nonce. The other parts of the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle
tree</a>, if any, are not sent, effectively limiting the amount of data which needs
to be sent to (at most) about a kilobyte at current transaction
volume.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>All of the other non-<a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a> information necessary to construct a
<a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> for the next <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> pool’s current <a href="/en/glossary/nbits" title="The target is the threshold below which a block header hash must be in order for the block to valid, and nBits is the encoded form of the target threshold as it appears in the block header." class="auto-link">target threshold</a> for accepting shares.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Using the <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transaction</a> received, the <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> software adds a
nonce to the <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase" title="A special field used as the sole input for coinbase transactions. The coinbase allows claiming the block reward and provides up to 100 bytes for arbitrary data." class="auto-link">coinbase</a> extra nonce field, hashes the <a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase
transaction</a>, and adds the hash to the received parts of the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-tree" title="A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and hashing the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root.  In Dash, the leaves are almost always transactions from a single block." class="auto-link">merkle tree</a>.
The tree is hashed as necessary to create a <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a>, which is added
to the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">block header</a> information received. Whenever the extra nonce field
needs to be changed, the <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> software updates and re-hashes the
<a href="/en/glossary/coinbase-transaction" title="The first transaction in a block.  Always created by a miner, it includes a single coinbase." class="auto-link">coinbase transaction</a>, rebuilds the <a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a>, and updates the <a href="/en/glossary/block-header" title="An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work." class="auto-link">header</a>
<a href="/en/glossary/merkle-root" title="The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in the tree.  Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all transactions in that block." class="auto-link">merkle root</a> field.</p>

  <p>Unlike <a href="/en/developer-reference#getblocktemplate" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblocktemplate</code></a>, <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> using Stratum cannot inspect or add
transactions to the <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain." class="auto-link">block</a> they’re currently <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a>. Also unlike
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getblocktemplate" class="auto-link"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblocktemplate</code></a>, the Stratum protocol uses a two-way TCP socket directly,
so <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">miners</a> don’t need to use HTTP longpoll to ensure they receive
immediate updates from <a href="/en/glossary/mining" title="Mining is the act of creating valid Dash blocks, which requires demonstrating proof of work, and miners are devices that mine or people who own those devices." class="auto-link">mining</a> pools when a new <a href="/en/glossary/block" title="One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work.
