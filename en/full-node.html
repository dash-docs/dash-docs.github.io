  <h2 id="what-is-a-full-node">What Is A Full Node?</h2>

  <p>A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks.
Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions
and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and
blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.</p>

  <p>Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to
transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a
transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this
function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer
network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.</p>

  <p>Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare
computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to
allow Bitcoin to continue to grow.  This document describes how you can
help and what helping will cost you.</p>

  <h2 id="costs-and-warnings">Costs And Warnings</h2>

  <p>Running a Bitcoin full node comes with certain costs and can expose you
to certain risks. This section will explain those costs and risks so you
can decide whether you’re able to help the network.</p>

  <h3 id="special-cases">Special Cases</h3>

  <p>Miners, businesses, and privacy-conscious users rely on particular
behavior from the full nodes they use, so they will often run their own
full nodes and take special safety precautions. This document does not
cover those precautions—it only describes running a full node to help
support the Bitcoin network in general.</p>

  <p>Please seek out assistance in the <a href="/en/community">community</a> if you need help
setting up your full node correctly to handle high-value and privacy-sensitive
tasks. Do your own diligence to ensure who you get help from is ethical,
reputable and qualified to assist you.</p>

  <h3 id="secure-your-wallet">Secure Your Wallet</h3>

  <p>It’s possible and safe to run a full node to support the network and use
its wallet to store your bitcoins, but you must take the same
precautions you would when using any Bitcoin wallet.  Please see the
<a href="/en/secure-your-wallet">securing your wallet page</a> for more
information.</p>

  <h3 id="minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>

  <p>Bitcoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a
node on weak hardware, it may work—but you’ll likely spend more time
dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you’ll
have an easy-to-use node.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS
X, or Linux.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>145 gigabytes of free disk space</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400
kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a
connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its
upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to
use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20
gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 140 gigabytes the first
time you start your node.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do
other things with your computer while running a full node.)
More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run
your node continuously.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> many operating systems today (Windows, Mac, and Linux) enter a
  low-power mode after the screensaver activates, slowing or halting
  network traffic. This is often the default setting on laptops and on
  all Mac OS X laptops and desktops. Check your screensaver settings
  and disable automatic “sleep” or “suspend” options to ensure you
  support the network whenever your computer is running.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="possible-problems">Possible Problems</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Legal:</strong> Bitcoin use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country">prohibited or restricted in some
areas.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Bandwidth limits</strong>: Some Internet plans will charge an additional
amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn’t included in
the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without
warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your
Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your
bandwidth use so that you can stop Bitcoin Core before you reach your
upload limit.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Anti-virus:</strong> Several people have placed parts of known computer
viruses in the Bitcoin block chain. This block chain data can’t infect
your computer, but some anti-virus programs quarantine the data
anyway, making it more difficult to run Bitcoin Core. This problem mostly
affects computers running Windows.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Attack target:</strong> Bitcoin Core powers the Bitcoin peer-to-peer
network, so people who want to disrupt the network may
attack Bitcoin Core users in ways that will affect other things
you do with your computer, such as an attack that limits your
available download bandwidth.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="linux-instructions">Linux Instructions</h2>

  <p>The following instructions describe installing Bitcoin Core on Linux
systems.</p>

  <h3 id="ubuntu-1610">Ubuntu 16.10</h3>

  <p>*Instructions for Bitcoin Core 0.14.2</p>

  <p>If you use Ubuntu Desktop, click the Ubuntu swirl icon to start the Dash and type “term” into the
input box. Choose any one of the terminals listed:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-dash-term.png" alt="Dash term" /></p>

  <p>Alternatively, access a console or terminal emulator using another
method, such as SSH on Ubuntu Server or a terminal launcher in an
alternative desktop environment.</p>

  <p>Type the following line to add the Bitcoin Personal Package Archive
(PPA) to your system:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>You will be prompted for your user password.  Provide it to continue.
Afterwards, the following text will be displayed:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>Stable Channel of bitcoin-qt and bitcoind for Ubuntu, and their
dependencies

Note that you should prefer to use the official binaries, where possible, to
limit trust in Launchpad/the PPA owner.

No longer supports precise, due to its ancient gcc and Boost versions.
More info: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin
Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Press enter to continue. The following text (with some variations) will
be displayed and you will be returned to the command line prompt:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpixuqu73x/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmpixuqu73x/pubring.gpg' created

</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Type the following line to get the most recent list of packages:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>A large number of lines will be displayed as different update files are
downloaded.  This step may take several minutes on a slow Internet
connection.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><em>To continue, choose one of the following options</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>To install the Bitcoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI), type the
following line and proceed to the <a href="#ubuntu-gui">Bitcoin Core GUI</a>
section below:</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code> sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To install the Bitcoin Core daemon (bitcoind), which is useful for
programmers and advanced users, type the following line and proceed
to the <a href="#ubuntu-daemon">Bitcoin Core Daemon</a> section below:</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code> sudo apt-get install bitcoind
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To install both the GUI and the daemon, type the following line and
read both the <a href="#ubuntu-gui">GUI instructions</a> and the <a href="#ubuntu-daemon">daemon
instructions</a>. Note that you can’t run both the GUI
and the daemon at the same time using the same configuration
directory.</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code> sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt bitcoind
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>After choosing what packages to install, you will be asked whether you
want to proceed.  Press enter to continue.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 id="ubuntu-gui" class="no_toc">Bitcoin Core GUI</h4>

  <p>To start Bitcoin Core GUI, click the Ubuntu swirl icon to open the Dash,
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin</code>, and click the Bitcoin icon.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-dash-bitcoin-qt.png" alt="Dash Bitcoin-Qt" /></p>

  <p>You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Bitcoin block
chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive
you want to use, click Ok to use the default.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-bitcoin-qt-welcome.png" alt="Bitcoin-Qt Welcome" /></p>

  <p>Bitcoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This
step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on
a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer.  During the
download, Bitcoin Core will use a significant part of your connection

  <h4 id="ubuntu-daemon" class="no_toc">Bitcoin Core Daemon</h4>

  <p>If you’re logged in as an administrative user with sudo access, you may
log out.  The steps in this section should be performed as the user you
want to run Bitcoin Core. (If you’re an expert administrator, you can
make this a locked account used only by Bitcoin Core.)</p>

  <p>From the terminal, type:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>bitcoind -daemon
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>It will print a message that Bitcoin Core is starting.  To interact with
Bitcoin Core daemon, you will use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin-cli</code> (Bitcoin
command line interface).</p>

  <p>Note: it may take up to several minutes for Bitcoin Core to start,
during which it will display the following message whenever you use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin-cli</code>:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>error: {"code":-28,"message":"Verifying blocks..."}
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic
interaction with your node:
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getblockchaininfo"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblockchaininfo</code></a>,
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getnetworkinfo"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getnetworkinfo</code></a>,
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getnettotals"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getnettotals</code></a>,
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getwalletinfo"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getwalletinfo</code></a>,
<a href="/en/developer-reference#stop"><code class="highlighter-rouge">stop</code></a>, and <a href="/en/developer-reference#help"><code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code></a>.</p>

  <p>For example, to safely stop your node, run the following command:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>bitcoin-cli stop
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>A complete list of commands is available in the <a href="/en/developer-reference#rpc-quick-reference">Bitcoin.org developer
reference</a>.</p>

  <p>When Bitcoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block
chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time
on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download,
Bitcoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can
stop Bitcoin Core at any time using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">stop</code> command; it will resume from the
point where it stopped the next time you start it.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><em>Optional: Start Your Node At Boot</em></p>

    <p>Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it
easy for you to contribute to the network.  The easiest way to do this
is to start Bitcoin Core daemon from your crontab.  To edit your
crontab, run the following command:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>crontab -e
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Scroll to the bottom of the file displayed and add the following line:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>@reboot bitcoind -daemon

  <h3 id="other-linux-distributions">Other Linux Distributions</h3>

  <p>*Instructions for Bitcoin Core 0.14.2</p>

  <p>The following instructions describe installing Bitcoin Core using tools
available in most mainstream Linux distributions.  We assume you use a
Bourne-like shell such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code>.</p>

  <p>Using any computer, go to the <a href="/en/download">Bitcoin Core download page</a>
and verify you have made a secure connection to the server.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-secure-connection.png" alt="Verify secure connection" /></p>

  <p>In the “Linux (tgz)” section of the Download page, choose the
appropriate file for your Linux install (either 32-bit or 64-bit) and
download the file. If necessary, move the file to the computer you want
to use to run Bitcoin Core.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><em>Optional: Verify the release signatures</em></p>

    <p>If you know how to use PGP, you should also click the <em>Verify Release
Signatures</em> link on the download page to download a signed list of SHA256
file hashes. The 0.11 and later releases are signed by <a href="/laanwj-releases.asc">Wladimir J. van
der Laan’s releases key</a> with the fingerprint:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Earlier releases were signed by <a href="/laanwj.asc">Wladimir J. van der Laan’s regular
key</a>. That key’s fingerprint is:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>71A3 B167 3540 5025 D447  E8F2 7481 0B01 2346 C9A6
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Even earlier releases were signed by <a href="/gavinandresen.asc">Gavin Andresen’s
key</a>. His primary key’s fingerprint is:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>2664 6D99 CBAE C9B8 1982  EF60 29D9 EE6B 1FC7 30C1
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You should verify these keys belong to their owners using the web of
trust or other trustworthy means. Then use PGP to verify the signature
on the release signatures file. Finally, use PGP or another utility to
compute the SHA256 hash of the archive you downloaded, and ensure the
computed hash matches the hash listed in the verified release
signatures file.</p>

  </div>

  <p>If you aren’t already logged into the computer you want to install
Bitcoin on, login now.  Make sure you use an account that can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">su</code>
or <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> to install software into directories owned by the root user.</p>

  <p>If you logged in graphically, start a terminal.  If you logged in
another way, we will assume you’re already in a shell.</p>

  <p>Locate the file you downloaded and extract it using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> command
followed by the argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">xzf</code> followed by the file name. The argument
<code class="highlighter-rouge">xzf</code> means eXtract the gZipped tar archive File. For example, for a
64-bit tar archive in your current directory, the command is:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>tar xzf bitcoin-0.14.2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This will create the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin-0.14.2</code> within your current
working directory. We will install the contents of its <code class="highlighter-rouge">bin</code>
subdirectory into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin</code> directory using the the <code class="highlighter-rouge">install</code>
command. The install command is part of the GNU coreutils available on
nearly every Linux distribution, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin</code> directory is a
standard location for self-installed executables (you may edit the
commands below to use a different location).</p>

  <p>If you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> to run commands as root, use the following command
line:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.14.2/bin/*
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>If you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">su</code> to run commands as root, use the following command line:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>su -c 'install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.14.2/bin/*'
</code></pre>

  <h4 id="other-linux-gui" class="no_toc">Bitcoin Core GUI</h4>

  <p>In order to use Bitcoin Core GUI, you will need several libraries
installed. All of them should be available in all major
recently-released Linux distributions, but they may not be installed on
your computer yet. To determine whether you’re missing any libraries,
open a terminal (if you haven’t already) and run the command
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt</code> to start Bitcoin Core GUI.</p>

  <p>If all the required libraries are installed, Bitcoin Core will start.
If a required library is missing, an error message similar to the
following message will be displayed:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>/usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt: error while loading shared libraries: libQtGui.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Search your distribution’s package database for the missing file
missing and install package containing that file.  Then re-run
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt</code> to see if it’s missing another file.
Repeat until Bitcoin Core GUI starts.</p>

  <p>You will be prompted to choose a directory to store the Bitcoin block
chain and your wallet.  Unless you have a separate partition or drive
you want to use, click <em>Ok</em> to use the default.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-bitcoin-qt-welcome.png" alt="Bitcoin-Qt Welcome" /></p>

Core into the default location, type the following at the command
prompt to see whether it works:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\daemon\bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
</code></pre>

<code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin-cli</code>:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>error: {"code":-28,"message":"Verifying blocks..."}
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>After it starts, you may find the following commands useful for basic
interaction with your node:
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getblockchaininfo"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getblockchaininfo</code></a>,

  <p>When Bitcoin Core daemon first starts, it will begin to download the block
chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time
on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download,
Bitcoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can
stop Bitcoin Core at any time using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">stop</code> command; it will resume from the
point where it stopped the next time you start it.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><em>Optional: Start Your Node At Boot</em></p>

    <p>Starting your node automatically each time your computer boots makes it

  <p>Bitcoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain.  This step will take at
least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection
or with a slow computer.  During the download, Bitcoin Core will use a
significant part of your connection bandwidth.  You can stop Bitcoin Core at any
time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time
you start it.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-osx-ibd.png" alt="Bitcoin Core Initial Block Download" /></p>

  <h4 id="osx-daemon" class="no_toc">Bitcoin Core Daemon</h4>

  <p>The Bitcoin Core daemon (bitcoind) is not included in the .dmg file you may have downloaded to install Bitcoin-QT. Bitcoind, along with its support binaries, is instead included in the OS X .tar.gz file listed on the official Bitcoin Core download page. To download this file using Terminal, execute the following command:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>curl -O https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.14.2/bitcoin-0.14.2-osx64.tar.gz

  <p>To support the Bitcoin network, you also need to allow incoming
connections. Please read the <a href="#network-configuration">Network
Configuration</a> section for details.</p>

  <h2 id="upgrading-bitcoin-core">Upgrading Bitcoin Core</h2>

  <p>If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).</p>

  <p>The blockchain and wallet files in the data directory are compatible between
versions so there is no requirement to make any changes to the data directory
when upgrading. Occasionally the format of those files changes, but the new
Bitcoin Core version will include code that automatically upgrades the files to
the new format so no manual intervention is required.</p>

  <p>Sometimes upgrade of the blockchain data files from very old versions to the new
versions is not supported. In those cases it may be necessary to redownload the
blockchain. Check the release notes of the new version if you are planning to
upgrade from a very old version.</p>

  <p>Sometimes downgrade is not possible because of changes to the data files. Again,
check the release notes for the new version if you are planning to downgrade.</p>

  <h2 id="network-configuration">Network Configuration</h2>

  <p>If you want to support the Bitcoin network, you must allow inbound
connections.</p>

  <p>When Bitcoin Core starts, it establishes 8 outbound connections to other
full nodes so it can download the latest blocks and transactions. If you
just want to use your full node as a wallet, you don’t need more than
these 8 connections—but if you want to support lightweight clients and
other full nodes on the network, you must allow inbound connections.</p>

  <p>Servers connected directly to the Internet usually don’t require any
special configuration.  You can use the testing instructions below to
confirm your server-based node accepts inbound connections.</p>

  <p>Home connections are usually filtered by a router or modem. Bitcoin
Core will request your router automatically configure itself to allow
inbound connections to Bitcoin’s port, port 8333. Unfortunately many
routers don’t allow automatic configuration, so you must manually
configure your router. You may also need to configure your firewall to
allow inbound connections to port 8333. Please see the following
subsections for details.</p>

  <h3 id="testing-connections">Testing Connections</h3>

  <p>The BitNodes project provides an online tool to let you test whether
your node accepts inbound connections. To use it, start Bitcoin Core
(either the GUI or the daemon), wait 10 minutes, and then <a href="https://bitnodes.21.co/#join-the-network">visit the
Bitnodes page</a>. The tool
will attempt to guess your IP address—if the address is wrong (or
blank), you will need to enter your address manually.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-bitnodes-tool.png" alt="Bitnodes Tool" /></p>

  <p>After you press Check Node, the tool will inform you whether your port
is open (green box) or not open (red box). If you get the green box, you
don’t need to do anything—you accept inbound connections.  If you get
the red box, please read the <a href="#enabling-connections">enabling
connections</a> subsection.</p>

  <p>For confirmation that you accept inbound connections, you can use
Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core can’t tell you directly whether you allow
inbound connections, but it can tell you whether or not you currently
have any inbound connections. If your node has been online for at least
30 minutes, it should normally have inbound connections. If want to
check your peer info using Bitcoin Core, choose the appropriate
instructions below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#gui-peer-info">Peer info in Bitcoin Core GUI</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="#daemon-peer-info">Peer info in Bitcoin Core daemon</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="gui-peer-info">GUI Peer Info</h4>

  <p>In the bottom right corner of the Bitcoin Core GUI are several icons.
If you hover over the signal strength icon, it will tell you how many
connections you have. The icon won’t turn green until you have more
than 8 active connections, which only happens if inbound connections
are allowed.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-active-connections.png" alt="Active connections" /></p>

  <p>For confirmation, you can go to the Help menu, choose Debug Window, and
open the Information tab. In the Network section, it will tell you
exactly how many inbound connections you have. If the number is greater
than zero, then inbound connections are allowed.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-debug-inbound-connections.png" alt="Debug window with inbound connections" /></p>

  <p>If you don’t have inbound connections, please read the instructions for <a href="#enabling-connections">enabling inbound
connections.</a></p>

  <h4 id="daemon-peer-info">Daemon Peer Info</h4>

  <p>The <a href="/en/developer-reference#getconnectioncount"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getconnectioncount</code></a>
command will tell you how many connections you have. If you have more
than 8 connections, inbound connections are allowed. For example:</p>

  <pre>$ <b>bitcoin-cli getconnectioncount</b>
52</pre>

  <p>For confirmation, you can use the
<a href="/en/developer-reference#getpeerinfo"><code class="highlighter-rouge">getpeerinfo</code></a> command to get
information about all of your peers.  Each peer’s details will include
an <code class="highlighter-rouge">inbound</code> field set to true if the connection is inbound.  If you
have any inbound connections, then inbound connections are allowed.</p>

  <p>If you don’t have inbound connections, please read instructions for <a href="#enabling-connections">enabling inbound
connections.</a></p>

  <h3 id="enabling-connections">Enabling Connections</h3>

  <p>If Bitcoin Core can’t automatically configure your router to open port
8333, you will need to manually configure your router.  We’ve tried to
make the following instructions generic enough to cover most router
models; if you need specific help with your router, please ask for help
on a tech support site such as <a href="http://superuser.com/">SuperUser</a>.</p>

  <p>Enabling inbound connections requires two steps, plus an extra third
step for firewall users:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Giving your computer a static (unchanging) internal IP address by
configuring the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on your
router.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Forwarding inbound connections from the Internet through your
router to your computer where Bitcoin Core can process them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Configuring your firewall to allow inbound connections. This step
mainly applies to Windows users, as Mac OS X and most Linuxes do not
enable a firewall by default.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="configuring-dhcp">Configuring DHCP</h4>

  <p>In order for your router to direct incoming port 8333 connections to
your computer, it needs to know your computer’s internal IP address.
However, routers usually give computers dynamic IP addresses that change
frequently, so we need to ensure your router always gives your computer
the same internal IP address.</p>

  <p>Start by logging into your router’s administration interface.  Most
routers can be configured using one of the following URLs, so keep
clicking links until you find one that works.  If none work, consult
your router’s manual.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://192.168.0.1">http://192.168.0.1</a> (some Linksys/Cisco models)</li>
    <li><a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a> (some D-Link/Netgear models)</li>
    <li><a href="http://192.168.2.1">http://192.168.2.1</a> (some Belkin/SMC models)</li>
    <li><a href="http://192.168.123.254">http://192.168.123.254</a> (some US Robotics models)</li>
    <li><a href="http://10.0.1.1">http://10.0.1.1</a> (some Apple models)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Upon connecting, you will probably be prompted for a username and
password.  If you configured a password, enter it now.  If not,
the <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/">Router Passwords site</a> provides a
database of known default username and password pairs.</p>

  <p>After logging in, you want to search your router’s menus for options
related to DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  These options
may also be called Address Reservation.  For example, the router page
shown below calls the option we need “DHCP Reservation”:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-dhcp-reservation.png" alt="DHCP reservation button" /></p>

  <p>In the reservation configuration, some routers will display a list of
computers and devices currently connected to your network, and then let
you select a device to make its current IP address permanent:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-easy-dhcp-reservation.png" alt="Easy DHCP reservation" /></p>

  <p>If that’s the case, find the computer running Bitcoin Core in the list,
select it, and add it to the list of reserved addresses. Make a note of
its current IP address—we’ll use the address in the next section.</p>

  <p>Other routers require a more manual configuration. For these routers,
you will need to look up the fixed address (MAC address) for your
computer’s network card and add it to the list. This operation differs
by operating system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Windows 7 &amp; 8:</strong> Press Win-R (Windows key plus the R key) to open
the Run dialog. Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd</code> to open the console. Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipconfig /all</code> and
find the result that best matches your connection—usually a wireless
connection. Look for a line that starts with “Physical Address” and
contains a value like this:</p>

      <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre><code>  Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 01-23-45-67-89-AB
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>Replace all the dashes with colons, so the address looks like this:
  01:23:45:67:89:AB.  Use that address in the instructions below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Linux:</strong> open a terminal and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code>. Find the result that
best matches your connection—a result starting with <code class="highlighter-rouge">wlan</code> indicates
a wireless connection. Find the field that starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">HWaddr</code> and copy
the immediately following field that looks like 01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use
that value in the instructions below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong> open a terminal and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code>. Find the result
that best matches your connection—a result starting with <code class="highlighter-rouge">en1</code>
usually indicates a wireless connection. Find the field that starts
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ether:</code> and copy the immediately following field that looks like
01:23:45:67:89:ab. Use that value in the instructions below.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you have the MAC address, you can fill it into to your router’s
manual DHCP assignment table, as illustrated below. Also choose an IP
address and make a note of it for the instructions in the next
subsection. After entering this information, click the Add or Save
button.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-manual-dhcp-reservation.png" alt="Manual DHCP reservation" /></p>

  <p>Then reboot your computer to ensure it gets assigned the address you
selected and proceed to the Port Forwarding instructions below.</p>

  <h4 id="port-forwarding">Port Forwarding</h4>

  <p>For this step, you need to know the local IP address of the computer
running Bitcoin Core. You should have this information from configuring
the DHCP assignment table in the subsection above.</p>

  <p>Login to your router using the same steps described near the top of the
<a href="#configuring-dhcp">DHCP subsection</a>.  Look for an option called Port Forwarding, Port
Assignment, or anything with “Port” in its name.  On the some routers,
this option is buried in an Applications &amp; Gaming menu.</p>

  <p>The port forwarding settings should allow you to map an external port on
your router to the “internal port” of a device on your network as shown
in the screenshot below.</p>

  <p><img src="/img/full-node/en-port-forwarding.png" alt="Port forwarding" /></p>

  <p>Both the external port and the internal port should be 8333 for Bitcoin.
(You may also want to map port 18333 for Bitcoin’s testnet, although
this guide does not cover using testnet.)  Make sure the IP address you
enter is the same one you configured in the previous subsection.</p>

  <p>After filling in the details for the mapping, save the entry. You should
not need to restart anything. Start Bitcoin Core (if you haven’t
already) and follow the <a href="#testing-connections">Testing Connections</a> instructions to test
your connection.</p>

  <p>If you still can’t connect and you use a firewall, you probably need to
change your firewall settings. See the Firewall section below.</p>

  <p>If something else went wrong, it’s probably a problem with your router
configuration. Re-read the instructions above to see if you missed
anything, search the web for help with “port forwarding”, and ask for
help on sites like <a href="http://superuser.com">SuperUser</a>.</p>

  <p>We can’t provide direct support, but if you see a way to improve these
instructions, please <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/new">open an issue.</a></p>

  <h4 id="firewall-configuration">Firewall Configuration</h4>

  <p>Firewalls block inbound connections.  To use Bitcoin, you need to
configure your computer’s firewall to allow connections to port 8333.
This is usually as easy as starting your firewall configuration software
and defining a new rule to allow inbound connections to port 8333.  For
additional information for Windows, see the links below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-port-windows-firewall#1TC=windows-7">Instructions for Windows Firewall</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100887">Instructions for Mcafee Personal Firewall</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Mac OS X comes with its firewall disabled by default, but if you have
enabled it, see the section Allowing Specific Applications from the
<a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642">official Apple guide.</a></p>

  <p>Ubuntu also comes with its firewall disabled by default, but if you have
enabled it, see the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw">Ubuntu wiki
page</a> for information about
adding port forwarding rules.</p>

  <p>Once you have allowed inbound connections to port 8333, start Bitcoin
Core (if you haven’t already) and follow the <a href="#testing-connections">Testing Connections</a>
instructions to test your connection.</p>

  <p>If something else went wrong re-read the DHCP, port forwarding, and
firewall instructions above to see if you missed anything, search the
web for help with “port forwarding” and “opening firewall ports”, and
ask for help on sites like <a href="http://superuser.com">SuperUser</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="configuration-tuning">Configuration Tuning</h2>

  <p>This section contains advice about how to change your Bitcoin Core
configuration to adapt it to your needs.</p>

  <p>There are two ways to change your configuration.  The first is to start
Bitcoin Core with the options you want.  For example, if you want to
limit it to using one CPU core for signature verification, you can start
Bitcoin Core like this:</p>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">## Bitcoin Core daemon</span>
bitcoind -par<span class="o">=</span>1 -daemon

<span class="c">## Bitcoin Core GUI</span>
bitcoin-qt -par<span class="o">=</span>1</code></pre></figure>

  <p>Once you’ve decided you like an option, you can add it to the Bitcoin
Core configuration file.  You can find that file in the following
directories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Windows: %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>OSX: $HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Linux: $HOME/.bitcoin/</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>To add an option to the configuration file, just remove its leading
dash.  You may also need to remove any quotation marks you used in your shell.
For example, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-par</code> option seen above would look like this in the
configuration file:</p>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">par=1</code></pre></figure>

  <p>A user-friendly configuration file generator is <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/">available here.</a>

  <h3 id="reduce-storage">Reduce Storage</h3>

  <p>It is possible to configure your node to to run in pruned mode in order to
reduce storage requirements. This can reduce the disk usage from over 145GB to
around 5GB.</p>

  <p>Running a node in pruned mode is incompatible with <code class="highlighter-rouge">-txindex</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-rescan</code>. It
also disables the RPC <code class="highlighter-rouge">importwallet</code>. Two RPCs that are available and
potentially helpful, however, are <code class="highlighter-rouge">importprunedfunds</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">removeprunedfunds</code>.</p>

  <p>To enable block pruning set <code class="highlighter-rouge">prune=N</code> on the command line or in <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitcoin.conf</code>,
where <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> is the number of MiB to allot for raw block and undo data.</p>

  <p>A value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> disables pruning. The minimal value above <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">550</code>. Your
wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones. Higher values
merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain reorganizations
of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in practice. In future
releases, a higher value may also help the network as a whole because stored
blocks could be served to other nodes.</p>

  <h3 id="reduce-traffic">Reduce Traffic</h3>

  <p>Some node operators need to deal with bandwidth caps imposed by their ISPs.</p>

  <p>By default, bitcoin-core allows up to 125 connections to different peers, 8 of
which are outbound. You can therefore, have at most 117 inbound connections.</p>

  <p>The default settings can result in relatively significant traffic consumption.</p>

  <p>Ways to reduce traffic:</p>

  <h4 id="maximum-upload-targets">Maximum Upload Targets</h4>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-maxuploadtarget=&lt;MiB per day&gt;</code></pre></figure>

  <p>A major component of the traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes
during the initial blocks download phase (syncing up a new node).
This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default.
This is <em>not</em> a hard limit; only a threshold to minimize the outbound
traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by no
longer serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Keep in mind that new nodes require other nodes that are willing to serve
historic blocks. <strong>The recommended minimum is 144 blocks per day (max. 144MB
per day)</strong></p>

  <h4 id="disable-listening">Disable listening</h4>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-listen=0</code></pre></figure>

  <p>Disabling listening will result in fewer nodes connected (remember the maximum of 8
outbound peers). Fewer nodes will result in less traffic usage as you are relaying
blocks and transactions to fewer nodes.</p>

  <h4 id="reduce-maximum-connections">Reduce maximum connections</h4>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-maxconnections=&lt;num&gt;</code></pre></figure>

  <p>Reducing the maximum connected nodes to a minimum could be desirable if traffic
limits are tiny. Keep in mind that bitcoin’s trustless model works best if you are
connected to a handful of nodes.</p>

  <h4 id="blocks-only-mode">Blocks-only mode</h4>

  <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-blocksonly</code></pre></figure>

  <p>Causes your node to stop requesting and relaying transactions unless they are
part of a block and also disables listening as described above.</p>

  <p>This reduces your node’s bandwidth to the absolute minimum necessary to stay
synchronized with the network, about 150 megabytes incoming data per day and
about 1 megabyte of outgoing data per day, but it does mean that your node
won’t see incoming transactions until they’ve received at least one confirmation.</p>

  <p>You will still be able to send transactions from the built-in wallet or from
peers you’ve whitelisted using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-whitelist</code> parameter.</p>
